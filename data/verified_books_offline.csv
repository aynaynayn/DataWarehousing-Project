When Breath Becomes Air,"First off, kudos for posting. Never easy to share these things.   If you haven’t already explored therapy, I’d recommend it. With that said, you asked for a book suggestion. I remember reading “When Breath Becomes Air”, which is written by a neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Not suggesting that’s the case for you, but it offers a unique perspective. It varies from “The last lecture” in the sense that it’s a bit more about perspective than following the authors story as he works towards his last lecture, but also a good book.",0.1898148148148148,2,motivation,21,P024,When Breath Becomes Air,100.0,"Paul Kalanithi, Abraham Verghese",2016.0

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"THE book I always read to make my old self feel better is “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” about a girl coming of age in poverty in the early 20th century.     (When a bite of pickle is a luxury, my own circumstances are…just fine, actually.)  Another fun one is “Forever Amber” a sort-of romance featuring Amber, irrepressible and ambitious in 1660s England. It’s not super raunchy but Amber is prone to affairs and marriages despite always wanting to be with her first love. It’s fun to root for Amber even when she does dumb stuff!  When my Grandma was quite blind, I got her a little Walkman (yes, was a while ago) with audiobooks of All Creatures Great And Small. Nothing raunchier than small dogs stuck together, and having a warm friendly voice telling stories, I thought, would be a comfort. Grandma hated it and used it for listening to cowboy music, so your mileage will vary.  Also, tell her I say hi! I’m 60+, freshly divorced and in a new place, too; plus the depression and anxiety are imperfectly controlled with drugs. It took about a year of dragging myself to coffee shops, used book stores, and garage sales before I finally stopped emitting social anxiety like a pigpen cloud.  I wish her good luck in getting out there! It helps!",0.11565882034632034,3,anxiety,34,P041,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,100.0,Betty  Smith,1943.0

A Man Called Ove,"A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It's about a grumpy elderly man definitely struggling with loneliness after his wife dies, he feels like he's lost his place in his neighborhood. He does attempt to end his life fyi but it's not gruesome, more despondent. A young family moves in and starts interacting with him, and he also begrudgingly acquires a cat. It flashes between present day and his early years meeting his wife. Very poignant and ultimately hopeful, finding a new lease in life in his later years. There are two film adaptations, one in Swedish with the same title and more recently A Man Called Otto with Tom Hanks.   Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. It has three perspectives - an elderly woman whose son was lost at sea, she works cleaning the aquarium. A young man (maybe 20s?) who is drifting through life and launches a poorly organized journey to discover who his father is. And Marcellus, an octopus at the aquarium who routinely sneaks out of his tank and forms a friendship with the woman.",0.1397727272727273,3,anxiety,34,P041,A Man Called Ove,100.0,"Fredrik Backman, Henning Koch",2012.0

We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate.

What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Bren頂rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.  ^(This book has been suggested 99 times)  ***  ^(128692 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",0.2662770562770563,1,discipline,152,P188,Rising Strong,100.0,Brené Brown,2015.0

A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"THE book I always read to make my old self feel better is “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” about a girl coming of age in poverty in the early 20th century.     (When a bite of pickle is a luxury, my own circumstances are…just fine, actually.)  Another fun one is “Forever Amber” a sort-of romance featuring Amber, irrepressible and ambitious in 1660s England.

When my Grandma was quite blind, I got her a little Walkman (yes, was a while ago) with audiobooks of All Creatures Great And Small. Nothing raunchier than small dogs stuck together, and having a warm friendly voice telling stories, I thought, would be a comfort. Grandma hated it and used it for listening to cowboy music, so your mileage will vary.  Also, tell her I say hi! I’m 60+, freshly divorced and in a new place, too; plus the depression and anxiety are imperfectly controlled with drugs. It took about a year of dragging myself to coffee shops, used book stores, and garage sales before I finally stopped emitting social anxiety like a pigpen cloud.

A Man Called Ove,"A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It's about a grumpy elderly man definitely struggling with loneliness after his wife dies, he feels like he's lost his place in his neighborhood. He does attempt to end his life fyi but it's not gruesome, more despondent. A young family moves in and starts interacting with him, and he also begrudgingly acquires a cat. It flashes between present day and his early years meeting his wife. Very poignant and ultimately hopeful, finding a new lease in life in his later years. There are two film adaptations, one in Swedish with the same title and more recently A Man Called Otto with Tom Hanks.   Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. It has three perspectives - an elderly woman whose son was lost at sea, she works cleaning the aquarium. A young man (maybe 20s?) who is drifting through life and launches a poorly organized journey to discover who his father is. And Marcellus, an octopus at the aquarium who routinely sneaks out of his tank and forms a friendship with the woman.",0.1397727272727273,3,depression,204,P249,A Man Called Ove,100.0,"Fredrik Backman, Henning Koch",2012.0

It’s Chapter 5: The Coldest Hart but it will make more sense with the context and background given in the other chapters.   They have another book *Born For Love* which is all about how people develop empathy starting in infancy and how that process can be derailed.

Hard to put down!  “The Bone Clocks” really a series of short stories all tied together by how the characters are related to each other and how they deal with these evil humans who are acting like psychic vampires. Amazing book. Audio book is even better. To see if you’d like it read the short story version “Slade House”.  Anything by Octavia Butler. It’s speculative fiction but they don’t feel like fantasy/sci-fi. They are focused on the characters and their relationships, and especially on power dynamics in society.  Extremely Fiction  “Gideon the Ninth” this book has people who had no happy childhoods, but is amazingly well written. The tagline is “lesbian necromancers in space”, but it’s more about the relationship between two women who fucking hate each other and are trying to get away from each other.  “Shades of Grey” by Jasper Fforde my favorite dystopia! About a boy who lives in a world where your status is determined by by how much color you can see. He falls in love with a grey, a lowest class woman, who shows him more than he wanted to see about his society. Makes you think about a lot of things in new ways.",0.11504665297038179,1,therapy,262,P319,The Bone Clocks,100.0,David Mitchell,2014.0

Feel the Fear ... and Do It Anyway,"Here are a few books that have made a real difference for me and might offer you some valuable insights and strategies:  [""The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem""](https://amzn.to/42VQQcM) by Nathaniel Branden - This book dives deep into what self-esteem really is and how to build it from the ground up. Branden breaks it down into six practices that you can work on, like living consciously and self-acceptance. It's a bit of a read, but it's packed with exercises and practical advice that can make a big difference.  [""Daring Greatly""](https://amzn.to/3UUwwH8) by Brené Brown - Brené Brown talks about vulnerability and how it's actually a strength, not a weakness. Her book really changed the way I look at myself and my interactions with others. It's about embracing who you are, flaws and all, and stepping into the world with more courage and confidence.  [""Feel the Fear ... and Do It Anyway""](https://amzn.to/3IcLY9L) by Susan Jeffers - This book is a classic for a reason. It's all about facing the fears that hold you back and developing the confidence to get past them. Jeffers provides practical tools and exercises to help you change your mindset and take control of your life.  [""Mindset: The New Psychology of Success""](https://amzn.to/3OWmOQp) by Carol S. Dweck - Dweck introduces the concept of ""fixed"" vs. ""growth"" mindsets and how they impact our lives, including our self-esteem. Understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed was a game-changer for me. It's a powerful read that can help you see challenges in a new light and boost your confidence in learning and growing.  [""Unfu\*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and into Your Life""](https://amzn.to/3TcZtNa) by Gary John Bishop - If you're looking for something more straightforward, this book cuts right to the chase. It's a no-nonsense guide to getting over your mental hurdles and taking action towards the life you want. It's motivating and can give you that kick to start making changes.  Each of these books offers something unique, from understanding the foundations of self-esteem to practical steps for building confidence and facing fears. It's okay to feel stuck sometimes, but with the right tools and a bit of effort, you can move forward. I hope these books help you as much as they've helped me.

It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic. > >Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal.

", The Rape of Nanking","**Notes From The Underground**. A short fiction (but it being so is of little consequence) of intense rambling by an overly self aware, self-destructing, neurotic. The book itself is a memoir of sorts, so by its nature it is self aware. But it is also aware in the sense that it is a story about his life as he tells it, and he tells it in layers of chaotic peelings of his consciousness. Which makes it oddly philosophical, and wonderfully psychological. The character constantly lies to you and admits to doing so while revelling in his own sick way, in the fact he is being an unreliable narrator. It is nihilism at its most desperate hour. My favourite book. I learn something new about myself every time I read it. Which is quite a wonderfully awful thing to do. It is your worst parts of yourself on display smashing you in your face as you read. What it is like to be on the outside of normal society, underground.  Aside from that, I occasionally like flipping through **The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**, but I wouldn't call it a face hugger of a book. Self-helpy in a sort of laissez faire way. **The Stranger** by Camus, was addicting and self helpy for my existential depression, but is not non-fiction. **The Selfish Gene** by Richard Dawkins was incredible, the insights it gives to evolutionary psychology were paradigm shifting for me. Took me too long to get over how pretentious he is and just read his work, which is actually quite good.    Honestly the most addicting books for me have been fiction. There are great books like The Red Queen by Matt Ridley about the evolutionary psychology of sexual selection, or other books about evolution and the ""why"" behind being a social species, which is self help to me, but they just don't suck me in the same way as.... Things Fall Apart, or The Bell Jar... simple easy fiction reads, that deal with not wanting to live and the nature of being human. I do love Russian literature fiction like Dostoevsky, not exactly light reading, and its quite off-putting for most with how pretentious its fans like myself, are, but oh well.   But for Non-fiction I love total suck fests like Night by Elie Wiesel, Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 by Christopher R. Browning, The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang, Unit 731 by Alistair Rogers, and The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Just absolute PTSD inducing jaw dropping brutality. Why? I have no idea. I may have visited the Anne Frank House too young and its my way to reconcile that shattering trip. Oh I'm rambling quite well now, toodles.

Paradises Lost,"Ursula Le Guin’s books frequently touch on these themes, if you’re open to fantasy/sci fi. Her father was an anthropologist and her books often consider how culture and ritual shape us in daily life, as well as the value of the seemingly mundane.  In particular, I would say *Tales from Earthsea* and some of the stories in *The Birthday of the World*, especially the story “Solitude” and the very end of the novella “Paradises Lost”.  Some of the Japanese healing novels also touch on these themes. *What You Are Looking For Is In The Library* by Michiko Aoyama is my personal favorite, and features different stories from intertwined characters who find new enjoyment and connection in simple things due to savvy recommendations from an unusual librarian.",0.06742424242424243,5,habits,519,P638,Paradise Lost,96.2962962962963,"John Milton, John      Leonard",1667.0

The Road,I recommend it strongly I will say it takes multiple readings to get all these hidden themes (which I argue makes it even a stronger book) and the last one about God and Adam was only after my third read through and reading elements of the bible which greatly influence McCarthy.   I will say it is a darker book so please be prepared for some scenes which require a small intermission or reflection (nothing extreme or too incredible graphic or sexual).   Also I would strongly suggest to look up any words you might not understand for with McCarthy's Blood Meridian and The Road he choose each word with care and compassion almost like he was setting each word on a printing press plate.  Also here is the link to the audio book which too me is the best audiobook production hands down. The narrator is bloody amazing and perfect.
