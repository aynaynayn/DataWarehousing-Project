    "comment": "First off, kudos for posting. Never easy to share these things.   If you haven’t already explored therapy, I’d recommend it. With that said, you asked for a book suggestion. I remember reading “When Breath Becomes Air”, which is written by a neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Not suggesting that’s the case for you, but it offers a unique perspective. It varies from “The last lecture” in the sense that it’s a bit more about perspective than following the authors story as he works towards his last lecture, but also a good book.",

    "comment": "THE book I always read to make my old self feel better is “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” about a girl coming of age in poverty in the early 20th century.     (When a bite of pickle is a luxury, my own circumstances are…just fine, actually.)  Another fun one is “Forever Amber” a sort-of romance featuring Amber, irrepressible and ambitious in 1660s England. It’s not super raunchy but Amber is prone to affairs and marriages despite always wanting to be with her first love. It’s fun to root for Amber even when she does dumb stuff!  When my Grandma was quite blind, I got her a little Walkman (yes, was a while ago) with audiobooks of All Creatures Great And Small. Nothing raunchier than small dogs stuck together, and having a warm friendly voice telling stories, I thought, would be a comfort. Grandma hated it and used it for listening to cowboy music, so your mileage will vary.  Also, tell her I say hi! I’m 60+, freshly divorced and in a new place, too; plus the depression and anxiety are imperfectly controlled with drugs. It took about a year of dragging myself to coffee shops, used book stores, and garage sales before I finally stopped emitting social anxiety like a pigpen cloud.  I wish her good luck in getting out there! It helps!",

    "title_raw": "A Man Called Ove",
    "comment": "A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It's about a grumpy elderly man definitely struggling with loneliness after his wife dies, he feels like he's lost his place in his neighborhood. He does attempt to end his life fyi but it's not gruesome, more despondent. A young family moves in and starts interacting with him, and he also begrudgingly acquires a cat. It flashes between present day and his early years meeting his wife. Very poignant and ultimately hopeful, finding a new lease in life in his later years. There are two film adaptations, one in Swedish with the same title and more recently A Man Called Otto with Tom Hanks.   Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. It has three perspectives - an elderly woman whose son was lost at sea, she works cleaning the aquarium. A young man (maybe 20s?) who is drifting through life and launches a poorly organized journey to discover who his father is. And Marcellus, an octopus at the aquarium who routinely sneaks out of his tank and forms a friendship with the woman.",

It delves into themes of identity, trauma, and the complexities of mental illness.  \t2.\t“She’s Come Undone” \t•\tDolores Price struggles with obesity, depression, and self-destructive behavior following a traumatic childhood event. The story explores her journey towards self-acceptance and mental health recovery.  \t3.\t“We Are Water” \t•\tThe novel tells the story of Annie Oh, an artist dealing with past trauma and mental illness as she prepares for her second marriage. It examines family dynamics, secrets, and the impact of untreated mental health issues.  \t4.\t“The Hour I First Believed” \t•\tCaelum Quirk and his wife, Maureen, cope with the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, which leads Maureen to struggle with PTSD. The novel addresses the long-term effects of trauma on mental health.  Some others I’ve read in recent years by different authors:  \t5.\t“Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine” by Gail Honeyman \t•\tThe novel centers on Eleanor Oliphant, a socially awkward woman with a traumatic past, as she begins to confront her loneliness and mental health issues.  \t6.\t“Sharp Objects” by Gillian Flynn \t•\tA psychological thriller about Camille Preaker, a journalist with a history of self-harm and mental illness, who returns to her hometown to investigate a series of murders.",

Sorry, i cant recall only one, maybe cuz tha stayed \"a monk who sold his ferrari\"  Lately i have been going through biographies, I think they are the real deal, like it has so many  perspectives, new insight and mainly the dreamers, the power to believe. It has really helped me alot. There is \"shoe dog, by Phil Knight, Steve Jobs by Isaacson, Into the wild.( but in general every book has th to offer, that makes us to search for sth more than ourselves) Starting my day with some of these reads, gives a headstart to my day, i am not in that negative mindset, so a little more confident. Its still hard for me to express myself but i know thats a great start. And also try incorporating some exercises in your routine, you will be amazed by the benefits and try putting yourself more out there in social platforms or even with other friends- a little at a time.",

The negative comments I hear about this book are because the tactics are often used by sales people to seem friendly and caring to improve their chances of making a sale. So I would recommend that you use the tips genuinely and not to try and sell someone something.",

It might not make you disciplined exactly BUT it could make you see how precious (and short) a life is and inspire you to use it... therefore then get disciplined!  Also perhaps read around something that interests you specifically, be it fiction or non fiction, and see if it fires up your passions, again driving you towards discipline.",

Another recommendation is one of my absolute favourites: \"The Secret Garden\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It's a children's novel, but it really is great for everyone and I think it is quite healing. All the best to you! 💛",

    "title_raw": "A Man Called Ove",
    "comment": "A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It's about a grumpy elderly man definitely struggling with loneliness after his wife dies, he feels like he's lost his place in his neighborhood. He does attempt to end his life fyi but it's not gruesome, more despondent. A young family moves in and starts interacting with him, and he also begrudgingly acquires a cat. It flashes between present day and his early years meeting his wife. Very poignant and ultimately hopeful, finding a new lease in life in his later years. There are two film adaptations, one in Swedish with the same title and more recently A Man Called Otto with Tom Hanks.   Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. It has three perspectives - an elderly woman whose son was lost at sea, she works cleaning the aquarium. A young man (maybe 20s?) who is drifting through life and launches a poorly organized journey to discover who his father is. And Marcellus, an octopus at the aquarium who routinely sneaks out of his tank and forms a friendship with the woman.",

    "comment": "*The Sociopath Next Door* by Martha Stout  *The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog* by Perry and Szalavitz is mostly about trauma, but there is a case study in there about a sociopathic murderer and how his upbringing almost certainly led him to be that way. It’s Chapter 5: The Coldest Hart but it will make more sense with the context and background given in the other chapters.   They have another book *Born For Love* which is all about how people develop empathy starting in infancy and how that process can be derailed. So it’s not specifically focused on sociopaths, but sociopathy is characterized by lack of empathy and conscience so it’s very much related. There’s a whole spectrum of case studies from a girl adopted from a neglectful Romanian orphanage to a teenage rapist.",

Both take place in the deserts of Australia and involve family drama/trauma. (tw - traumatic childhood)  If you’d like a historical fiction YA book that’s will make you feel better:  “The War that Saved my Life” about a girl and her brother who were evacuated from London during WWII, from an abusive home to a kind home.  If you’d like a book that’s YA and a little harder to make sense of (like a puzzle) until it all becomes clear:  “Challenger Deep” by Neil Schusterman. A gentle book About a boy dealing with the beginnings of schizophrenia.   More fictional books:  “Circe” is really good book about loneliness that is fiction because it is about Gods and Goddesses of Greece, but is more focused on emotions. Slow and deep.  “The Girl with all the Gifts” - an intellectual zombie story that reads like a fast-paced first person story. Hard to put down!  “The Bone Clocks” really a series of short stories all tied together by how the characters are related to each other and how they deal with these evil humans who are acting like psychic vampires. Amazing book. Audio book is even better. To see if you’d like it read the short story version “Slade House”.  Anything by Octavia Butler. It’s speculative fiction but they don’t feel like fantasy/sci-fi. They are focused on the characters and their relationships, and especially on power dynamics in society.  Extremely Fiction  “Gideon the Ninth” this book has people who had no happy childhoods, but is amazingly well written. The tagline is “lesbian necromancers in space”, but it’s more about the relationship between two women who fucking hate each other and are trying to get away from each other.  “Shades of Grey” by Jasper Fforde my favorite dystopia! About a boy who lives in a world where your status is determined by by how much color you can see. He falls in love with a grey, a lowest class woman, who shows him more than he wanted to see about his society. Makes you think about a lot of things in new ways.",

    "comment": "Here are a few books that have made a real difference for me and might offer you some valuable insights and strategies:  [\"The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem\"](https://amzn.to/42VQQcM) by Nathaniel Branden - This book dives deep into what self-esteem really is and how to build it from the ground up. Branden breaks it down into six practices that you can work on, like living consciously and self-acceptance. It's a bit of a read, but it's packed with exercises and practical advice that can make a big difference.  [\"Daring Greatly\"](https://amzn.to/3UUwwH8) by Brené Brown - Brené Brown talks about vulnerability and how it's actually a strength, not a weakness. Her book really changed the way I look at myself and my interactions with others. It's about embracing who you are, flaws and all, and stepping into the world with more courage and confidence.  [\"Feel the Fear ... and Do It Anyway\"](https://amzn.to/3IcLY9L) by Susan Jeffers - This book is a classic for a reason. It's all about facing the fears that hold you back and developing the confidence to get past them. Jeffers provides practical tools and exercises to help you change your mindset and take control of your life.  [\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\"](https://amzn.to/3OWmOQp) by Carol S. Dweck - Dweck introduces the concept of \"fixed\" vs. \"growth\" mindsets and how they impact our lives, including our self-esteem. Understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed was a game-changer for me. It's a powerful read that can help you see challenges in a new light and boost your confidence in learning and growing.  [\"Unfu\\*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and into Your Life\"](https://amzn.to/3TcZtNa) by Gary John Bishop - If you're looking for something more straightforward, this book cuts right to the chase. It's a no-nonsense guide to getting over your mental hurdles and taking action towards the life you want. It's motivating and can give you that kick to start making changes.  Each of these books offers something unique, from understanding the foundations of self-esteem to practical steps for building confidence and facing fears. It's okay to feel stuck sometimes, but with the right tools and a bit of effort, you can move forward. I hope these books help you as much as they've helped me. Hang in there, and remember that seeking help is a huge step forward in itself.",

I remember reading “When Breath Becomes Air”, which is written by a neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Not suggesting that’s the case for you, but it offers a unique perspective. It varies from “The last lecture” in the sense that it’s a bit more about perspective than following the authors story as he works towards his last lecture, but also a good book.",

Cannery Row might be a better fit. Although even that one has kind of a bittersweet feel as well.",

It's a story of a little flame in complete darkness. I felt like having a kid after finishing it if that helps you see the restored faith in humanity.  MaCarthy dedicated the book to his son which made the dialogue between the characters all that more intriguing.  Alert: graphic scenes of horror.",

    "title_raw": ", The Rape of Nanking",
    "comment": "**Notes From The Underground**. A short fiction (but it being so is of little consequence) of intense rambling by an overly self aware, self-destructing, neurotic. The book itself is a memoir of sorts, so by its nature it is self aware. But it is also aware in the sense that it is a story about his life as he tells it, and he tells it in layers of chaotic peelings of his consciousness. Which makes it oddly philosophical, and wonderfully psychological. The character constantly lies to you and admits to doing so while revelling in his own sick way, in the fact he is being an unreliable narrator. It is nihilism at its most desperate hour. My favourite book. I learn something new about myself every time I read it. Which is quite a wonderfully awful thing to do. It is your worst parts of yourself on display smashing you in your face as you read. What it is like to be on the outside of normal society, underground.  Aside from that, I occasionally like flipping through **The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**, but I wouldn't call it a face hugger of a book. Self-helpy in a sort of laissez faire way. **The Stranger** by Camus, was addicting and self helpy for my existential depression, but is not non-fiction. **The Selfish Gene** by Richard Dawkins was incredible, the insights it gives to evolutionary psychology were paradigm shifting for me. Took me too long to get over how pretentious he is and just read his work, which is actually quite good.    Honestly the most addicting books for me have been fiction. There are great books like The Red Queen by Matt Ridley about the evolutionary psychology of sexual selection, or other books about evolution and the \"why\" behind being a social species, which is self help to me, but they just don't suck me in the same way as.... Things Fall Apart, or The Bell Jar... simple easy fiction reads, that deal with not wanting to live and the nature of being human. I do love Russian literature fiction like Dostoevsky, not exactly light reading, and its quite off-putting for most with how pretentious its fans like myself, are, but oh well.   But for Non-fiction I love total suck fests like Night by Elie Wiesel, Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 by Christopher R. Browning, The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang, Unit 731 by Alistair Rogers, and The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Just absolute PTSD inducing jaw dropping brutality. Why? I have no idea. I may have visited the Anne Frank House too young and its my way to reconcile that shattering trip. Oh I'm rambling quite well now, toodles. Oh and I do not recommend these last books.",

No personal commentary at all, just a detailed and very well written natural diary.",

At seventeen, in the dark of night, he left the religious settlement, but it was only nine years later that he finally left the church for good. His favorite Bible verse is from Psalm 34: \"Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.\" In this new memoir, he tells what it was like growing up Old World Amish and what it felt like leaving it for a strange new world. Far more than picturesque; Growing Up Amish conveys one man's heartfelt experience.  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  ***  ^(170242 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

In un freddo pomeriggio di febbraio, Sonia apre la porta di casa a Jez, 15 anni, un amico del figlio. Il ragazzo vorrebbe vedere un raro disco di vinile, pensa di restare qualche minuto e andare via. Non uscirà più. Con una folle progressione geometrica, un passo dopo l’altro, Sonia fa in modo che Jez non lasci la casa sul fiume, fino a quando non scoprirà di esserne prigioniero, di non poter chiedere aiuto. La sola possibilità che gli restaè trovare un modo per convivere con lei, con quella donna che lo considera una cosa sua, un oggetto da proteggere, da custodire. Non ha altra strada se non venire a patti con la sua carceriera: del resto, chi lo cercherebbe mai in quella splendida, vecchia dimora in riva al Tamigi? Chi sospetterebbe di unamoglie e madre esemplare, che non ha mai mostrato alcun segno di squilibrio? La casa sul fiume è la storia di un’ossessione, di uno smarrimento che affonda le sue radici nei meandri più oscuri della psiche. Ed è la storia di una donna reale e vera come solo il dolore sa esserlo: perché la sua solitudine, i suoi ricordi, i suoi moventi parlano al cuore di ognuno di noi.  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  [**Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46815.Wasted)  ^(By: Marya Hornbacher | 298 pages | Published: 1997 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, memoir, nonfiction, memoirs, psychology | )[^(Search \"Wasted\")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Wasted&search_type=books)  >Why would a talented young woman enter into a torrid affair with hunger, drugs, sex, and death?

In un freddo pomeriggio di febbraio, Sonia apre la porta di casa a Jez, 15 anni, un amico del figlio. Il ragazzo vorrebbe vedere un raro disco di vinile, pensa di restare qualche minuto e andare via. Non uscirà più. Con una folle progressione geometrica, un passo dopo l’altro, Sonia fa in modo che Jez non lasci la casa sul fiume, fino a quando non scoprirà di esserne prigioniero, di non poter chiedere aiuto. La sola possibilità che gli restaè trovare un modo per convivere con lei, con quella donna che lo considera una cosa sua, un oggetto da proteggere, da custodire. Non ha altra strada se non venire a patti con la sua carceriera: del resto, chi lo cercherebbe mai in quella splendida, vecchia dimora in riva al Tamigi? Chi sospetterebbe di unamoglie e madre esemplare, che non ha mai mostrato alcun segno di squilibrio? La casa sul fiume è la storia di un’ossessione, di uno smarrimento che affonda le sue radici nei meandri più oscuri della psiche. Ed è la storia di una donna reale e vera come solo il dolore sa esserlo: perché la sua solitudine, i suoi ricordi, i suoi moventi parlano al cuore di ognuno di noi.  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  [**Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46815.Wasted)  ^(By: Marya Hornbacher | 298 pages | Published: 1997 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, memoir, nonfiction, memoirs, psychology | )[^(Search \"Wasted\")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Wasted&search_type=books)  >Why would a talented young woman enter into a torrid affair with hunger, drugs, sex, and death?

    "comment": "Ursula Le Guin’s books frequently touch on these themes, if you’re open to fantasy/sci fi. Her father was an anthropologist and her books often consider how culture and ritual shape us in daily life, as well as the value of the seemingly mundane.  In particular, I would say *Tales from Earthsea* and some of the stories in *The Birthday of the World*, especially the story “Solitude” and the very end of the novella “Paradises Lost”.  Some of the Japanese healing novels also touch on these themes. *What You Are Looking For Is In The Library* by Michiko Aoyama is my personal favorite, and features different stories from intertwined characters who find new enjoyment and connection in simple things due to savvy recommendations from an unusual librarian.",

    "comment": "I recommend it strongly I will say it takes multiple readings to get all these hidden themes (which I argue makes it even a stronger book) and the last one about God and Adam was only after my third read through and reading elements of the bible which greatly influence McCarthy.   I will say it is a darker book so please be prepared for some scenes which require a small intermission or reflection (nothing extreme or too incredible graphic or sexual).   Also I would strongly suggest to look up any words you might not understand for with McCarthy's Blood Meridian and The Road he choose each word with care and compassion almost like he was setting each word on a printing press plate.  Also here is the link to the audio book which too me is the best audiobook production hands down. The narrator is bloody amazing and perfect.
