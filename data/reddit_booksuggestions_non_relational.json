It was written before he became a born-again Christian, but the advice and anecdotal stories are so...he has a special way of making things make sense and feel not so scary to change and improve and build the life you actually want. I highly recommend it. Bell Hooks took her definition of love from that book for her book All About Love.     Also, The Wisdom of Insecurity by Alan Watts. It's not as casual reading, not academic either, but Watts did not water down his writing to be more palatable. He does make eastern spirituality, specifically zen buddhism and taoism accessible for western audiences. And he's actually quite clever and witty. Just his writing style is very calming.     Finally, for a novel, Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. It's a fictional imagining of a Buddha's life (not the Buddha, but he does meet him at a point). Very calming and inspirational. And it reads kind of like Proverbs if biblical literature tickles your fancy.",

You could just be mindful in your daily life it's really just concentrating on the present, on the feeling on your feet on the floor, sounds around you. It doesn't have to be a meditation. It's a bit like that anxiety exercise where you name things you can see. However we're all different and if that's not for you fair enough. I have anxiety and the focus on your breathing bit can be tricky. I prefer the ones that let you just sit there and be present, it's hard to explain   A book I read that was helpful was called The Happiness trap. Explaining how we can't force ourselves to be happy. It's useful for the ideas if like me you don't like the exercises (they're like mindfulness but I couldn't get on with following the instructions)if follows principles from acceptance, commitment therapy and mindfulness.",

I don’t know about motivation, but escapism is what has helped me during the times you’re referencing.   I think the motivation that would propel you to read a book might carry over into the rest of your life instead of trying to find a secretly motivating book.   I’d recommend a Psalm for the Wild Built. I know it’s recommended here a lot, but it really will help you slow down and make it through these trials.   I also would recommend Piranesi. The optimistic naïveté combined with a never-give-up attitude when he is stuck in a genuinely horrible situation will never not be inspiring.   Now both of those are pretty commonly recommended on here, almost to a meme level. If they aren’t your cup of tea, I’d try the Hike by Drew Magary. The protagonist MUST keep moving forward to get back to the life he’s lost. It’s weird, it’s insightful, and I still think about it over a year later. If that book doesn’t fill you with unwavering determination, idk what will.   To talk philosophy, I love recommending Michael Schur’s How to Be Perfect.

I don’t know about motivation, but escapism is what has helped me during the times you’re referencing.   I think the motivation that would propel you to read a book might carry over into the rest of your life instead of trying to find a secretly motivating book.   I’d recommend a Psalm for the Wild Built. I know it’s recommended here a lot, but it really will help you slow down and make it through these trials.   I also would recommend Piranesi. The optimistic naïveté combined with a never-give-up attitude when he is stuck in a genuinely horrible situation will never not be inspiring.   Now both of those are pretty commonly recommended on here, almost to a meme level. If they aren’t your cup of tea, I’d try the Hike by Drew Magary. The protagonist MUST keep moving forward to get back to the life he’s lost. It’s weird, it’s insightful, and I still think about it over a year later. If that book doesn’t fill you with unwavering determination, idk what will.   To talk philosophy, I love recommending Michael Schur’s How to Be Perfect. He goes over philosophical teachings applied to everyday life, and is pretty funny.   I hope you make it through - you got this!",

        "text": "It sounds to me like really what you need is therapy next to help you get treatment for where you are now and how you are not happy with your life. It kind of seems like maybe you are having this excuse that you need to \"research it\" and understand it more but I disagree, you can understand perfectly all about addictions and still have problems.   \"Friends lovers and the big terrible thing\", is Matthew Perry's biography. He passed not long ago. He talks about his struggles with addiction and how he knew all about them, he had so much time in rehabs and so much education but none of those things fixed the addiction. So, he was in and out of rehab centers. I do not recommend this book for you, it is depressing and I don't think it will help you. I just understand that there is someone out there who had access to all the best resources, all the best research, all the best people, and still they struggled with addictions.   The book \"Dopamine Nation\"  is a very good book that talks about addictions, how they work, and how people get wrapped up in different addictions including a person who had a sex addiction to the point where they would miss work for several days. So this book has what you're looking for, but it won't help you with where you're at now. It's fine to read it, but it's kind of a waste of your time.   What I recommend is a publication on the internet that is called \"Rat Park\", I think this will help you and I think it will be easier for you to digest because it talks about the substance addictions of drugs. This online Internet publication (it has lots and lots of pictures) will help you to understand more about where you are and what might be going wrong.  I understand the purpose of this sub is to recommend books, but the problem is that you are trying to look for a specific type of book that will help you to understand things but I don't think that's going to help you. I strongly recommend therapy as the next step for you to help you with your addiction. If you are not ready or if you can't afford it or if there is several months late, there is a video that has been helping a lot of people to understand more about their life \"Dr k: we are producing millions of lonely, addicted, purposeless men and women\", it is motivational and I highly highly recommend it for you. I know it's a long video so even if you can just get through the first hour. Essentially what this video is saying is the same thing as the Rat Park publication, when there are things missing from your life it becomes easier to gravitate towards the addiction and to use the addiction to substitute something wrong in your life.  And Matthew Perry's biography, he did not feel supported and seen and loved by his parents and he chased this his entire life. He dedicated his whole entire life to getting it, became an actor to get all of those things from the audience of the whole wide world, gravitated towards substance abuse to get those things, women, and so on. And in the end, his parents started to come back around and love him more but it still was not enough to fill in the hole in his life. What he needed was therapy to help him to continue to fill in the hole himself. Because that's the core part of addiction, only you can start to fill in this hole with therapy and education and hard work on your inner self, and do what you need to do and get the things going in your life that you need. Having a life, having friends, having hobbies, all of those things are the core things that humans need.  I don't quite know what your problem is and why you have ended up at this addiction to try to cure that problem, but I would recommend that you look at any books that talk about \"Shadow work\" (that is, the parts of you that are inside you, inside the shadow, that are not seen), try doing an emotional attachment style quiz to see if that is the symptom of a bigger problem, maybe think about if you have problems growing up and if the book \"adult children of emotionally immature parents\" would work for you.  If you are having suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a helpline and speak to someone immediately. No book, video, or publication can fix that, please reach out and speak to someone.",

It’s not even a logical leap that someone with little sexual interest would be undeserving of a relationship. This is because relationships that last longer often need something other than sexual chemistry to make the effort worth it for both parties.   I’m not going to argue that porn addiction isn’t harmful. Any addiction can and usually eventually will harm you. However, I know of no anti-porn literature that is not also littered with guilt inspiring language that is designed to make you feel like a worm instead of a human being.   It’s just as likely that you became addicted to pornography because you were depressed and looking for something, anything, to make you feel good for a time. Suicidal thoughts are only one of the advanced signs of depression. Because I know this about depression, I encourage you to find counseling. And because of your mention of porn addiction I encourage you to find counseling that is medically based and not religiously based if possible.   Recovering from depression while consuming literature and other messaging that tells you that you are not worthy of being saved is not possible. If you want to survive depression, you will need to reject that messaging rather than pursuing it.",

Schuster shares her journey from self-sabotage to self-care in a way that’s both relatable and inspiring. The book challenges traditional self-help narratives and emphasizes the importance of building a life that nurtures you—without waiting for permission. It’s a great read for reclaiming your power, and I bet your professor would find its unapologetic tone… interesting.",

As someone with a STEM job which can be similarly demanding, all I can say is often your performance is based on your environment - if your environment is toxic, you won't be able to perform to your best capabilites while in a more holistic and positive environment you'll see yourself cross your limits and improve more than you expect.   A lot of my peers, who I know to be very smart, underperformed at a company which rhymes with jamazon due to the high pressure and toxic work culture. They outperformed themselves at ambitious startups which had an equally demanding workload but a more positive work culture.",

Both mood-lifting books are by Agatha Christie:  *The Secret of Chimneys*  *Partners in Crime*  My reasoning for these recs is that the books are from the 1920s, and that was a historical time similar to the struggles we're going through now.  I think the toxic environment you describe is incredibly common now, and is a sign of the times.  Escapist books written back then hit the right note to give hope to working age people hit by the challenges of strong global tensions (the 20s were smack in the middle of two world wars), a tech boom (the Industrial Revolution) hitting a wall, multiple pandemics, all on the tail end of a baby boom (the Victorian age), with the resultant effects on the economy.  A lot of stuff from the 1920s - 1940s were cheerful in mood and aimed to help people through those hard times.",

It’s about a guy who is forced to reconsider what he is to do with his life at the same time he has a chance discovery of a farm for sale that becomes perhaps divine providence. He then brings his closest friends into a loose partnership into the unknown. It’s a character driven story where all the characters are fully fleshed out from their early lives and what made them into who they are. Has a few philosophical and a girl with supernatural powers she is learning how to control that adds to the mystique of the book as a whole.  It’s a prequel to another book but they can be enjoyed by themselves or together or in any order. I recommend Familiaris first then Edgar Sawtelle second if you want to do both. Familiaris if you only want to do one.",

        "text": "THE book I always read to make my old self feel better is “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” about a girl coming of age in poverty in the early 20th century.     (When a bite of pickle is a luxury, my own circumstances are…just fine, actually.)  Another fun one is “Forever Amber” a sort-of romance featuring Amber, irrepressible and ambitious in 1660s England. It’s not super raunchy but Amber is prone to affairs and marriages despite always wanting to be with her first love. It’s fun to root for Amber even when she does dumb stuff!  When my Grandma was quite blind, I got her a little Walkman (yes, was a while ago) with audiobooks of All Creatures Great And Small. Nothing raunchier than small dogs stuck together, and having a warm friendly voice telling stories, I thought, would be a comfort. Grandma hated it and used it for listening to cowboy music, so your mileage will vary.  Also, tell her I say hi! I’m 60+, freshly divorced and in a new place, too; plus the depression and anxiety are imperfectly controlled with drugs. It took about a year of dragging myself to coffee shops, used book stores, and garage sales before I finally stopped emitting social anxiety like a pigpen cloud.  I wish her good luck in getting out there! It helps!",

        "text": "A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. It's about a grumpy elderly man definitely struggling with loneliness after his wife dies, he feels like he's lost his place in his neighborhood. He does attempt to end his life fyi but it's not gruesome, more despondent. A young family moves in and starts interacting with him, and he also begrudgingly acquires a cat. It flashes between present day and his early years meeting his wife. Very poignant and ultimately hopeful, finding a new lease in life in his later years. There are two film adaptations, one in Swedish with the same title and more recently A Man Called Otto with Tom Hanks.   Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. It has three perspectives - an elderly woman whose son was lost at sea, she works cleaning the aquarium. A young man (maybe 20s?) who is drifting through life and launches a poorly organized journey to discover who his father is. And Marcellus, an octopus at the aquarium who routinely sneaks out of his tank and forms a friendship with the woman.",

        "text": "Hey, I hope you find your book answer here, but just wanted to leave a few thoughts.  Finding books to help you with this is just an escapism. What you need is to make an actual steps towards working on stuff that you find problematic and on which you feel less confident. If it's looks, then working out and nutrition. If it's knowledge, then learning about that particular topics etc.  You can find a book that could help you with *such* steps, but it's more of a custom process to each person. Finding books that would make you \"be content with who you are now\" won't help you much - and they **shouldn't**. If you were satisfied with how you are now, you wouldn't be feeling that way. On that same page, where you are now might not even be bad (idk so I'm not saying it for a fact), but wanting more of life is great and you should go for it!  Feeling confident is your body having internal affirmation for what you say you are. I can't say for myself that I'm a dependable man if I don't keep my word, don't make it in time etc. Can't say I feel good in my body if I don't feel like I like how I look at the moment. So getting confident in specific area is you doing stuff that would then be an affirmation to inner you that yeah, you are that.  Going \"fake it until you make it\" is a good start, but it's not a long-term possible solution. It's good to make you take that initial step, when you need the most courage for, but then it's all about showing up (for yourself!!) and doing what you need to do.  I wish you all the best and to go push through those struggles! You got it!  A book recommendations - not a book, but a manga - Berserk! Note: There's a lot of graphic stuff (like r\\*pe, gore, kil\\*ing etc.), but the struggle main character is going through and enduring I think is great. Also, if you want to chill out a bit and relax, also a manga recommendation - Grand Blue Dreaming. It's hilarious and I loved it!",

It’s a disorder that will present differently in each individual case, so I think the author did a good job of detailing the trauma and the resulting effects on the person, so that someone unaffected can understand the depth of the disorder. It’s the only book I can think of where the individual isn’t the villain, so it was nice to have the script flipped and force the reader to feel empathy.",

But now I can say with confidence that I feel much much better.   The first and most important thing is mediation. There are tons of different methods out there, learn one, do it regularly and with discipline. You can start with 5 min per session. But it's magical....

Really interesting and insightful. He also has a podcast!",

I’m finding that this world of social media, technology and the overall fixation in our society on negativity and the isolation is creating more loneliness and mental health issues than ever before. The cure is to have a higher power, get outside, take care of yourself, your physical and mental health, work on connections, and honestly it’s crazy but that’s seems so hard to do now. I’m a gen xer and doing those things was normal and natural until the last 15 years since the smart phone. So, don’t feel bad OP lots of people are struggling and you can get through this.

The subject revolves around tragedy in the lives of the main characters and their struggles to overcome. It's really quite beautiful.

The first is My Mister, and I always recommend that one to people who struggle with depression. The other is It's Okay to Not Be Okay.",

I thought her character development was incredible and loved watching her blossom.  From wikipedia: King has characterized Gibney as \"an **obsessive compulsive with a huge inferiority complex**\". She has been described as \"very observant, refreshingly unfiltered and unaware of her innocence\" with \"savant-like memory, razor sharp observation skills\", as well as \"a computer whiz\"",

It delves into themes of identity, trauma, and the complexities of mental illness.  \t2.\t“She’s Come Undone” \t•\tDolores Price struggles with obesity, depression, and self-destructive behavior following a traumatic childhood event. The story explores her journey towards self-acceptance and mental health recovery.  \t3.\t“We Are Water” \t•\tThe novel tells the story of Annie Oh, an artist dealing with past trauma and mental illness as she prepares for her second marriage. It examines family dynamics, secrets, and the impact of untreated mental health issues.  \t4.\t“The Hour I First Believed” \t•\tCaelum Quirk and his wife, Maureen, cope with the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, which leads Maureen to struggle with PTSD. The novel addresses the long-term effects of trauma on mental health.  Some others I’ve read in recent years by different authors:  \t5.\t“Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine” by Gail Honeyman \t•\tThe novel centers on Eleanor Oliphant, a socially awkward woman with a traumatic past, as she begins to confront her loneliness and mental health issues.  \t6.\t“Sharp Objects” by Gillian Flynn \t•\tA psychological thriller about Camille Preaker, a journalist with a history of self-harm and mental illness, who returns to her hometown to investigate a series of murders.",

ETA: Vizzini wrote the book as kind of a reflection of his own experiences with MH. He later committed suicide. So, this book doesn’t romanticize MH issues.

After reading it, I didn’t apply everything (because it’s a bit much 😅) but I did start with a morning routine centered on myself. Taking that bit of time to focus on yourself, read self-development or just feel-good books, etc. With time, it really helped me respect myself more, love myself more and be less on edge.

        "text": "Hey, I hope you find your book answer here, but just wanted to leave a few thoughts.  Finding books to help you with this is just an escapism. What you need is to make an actual steps towards working on stuff that you find problematic and on which you feel less confident. If it's looks, then working out and nutrition. If it's knowledge, then learning about that particular topics etc.  You can find a book that could help you with *such* steps, but it's more of a custom process to each person. Finding books that would make you \"be content with who you are now\" won't help you much - and they **shouldn't**. If you were satisfied with how you are now, you wouldn't be feeling that way. On that same page, where you are now might not even be bad (idk so I'm not saying it for a fact), but wanting more of life is great and you should go for it!  Feeling confident is your body having internal affirmation for what you say you are. I can't say for myself that I'm a dependable man if I don't keep my word, don't make it in time etc. Can't say I feel good in my body if I don't feel like I like how I look at the moment. So getting confident in specific area is you doing stuff that would then be an affirmation to inner you that yeah, you are that.  Going \"fake it until you make it\" is a good start, but it's not a long-term possible solution. It's good to make you take that initial step, when you need the most courage for, but then it's all about showing up (for yourself!!) and doing what you need to do.  I wish you all the best and to go push through those struggles! You got it!  A book recommendations - not a book, but a manga - Berserk! Note: There's a lot of graphic stuff (like r\\*pe, gore, kil\\*ing etc.), but the struggle main character is going through and enduring I think is great. Also, if you want to chill out a bit and relax, also a manga recommendation - Grand Blue Dreaming. It's hilarious and I loved it!",

Instead of being read about confidence, which often fell flat with me, you could read your daughter a book about a character that deals with bullying. Each chapter could be a conversation about how the character dealt with it and why that was a good/bad decision.   The first suggestion off my head is Harry Potter, especially the first book. It doesn’t focus exclusively on bullies, but it has multiple characters that do bully Harry, including adults which is an important conversation. When I was around her age, my teacher bullied me, which was hard to tell my parents. It also deals with bullies a little more complexly, like how the “bad guy” can be someone that is nice to you.  This might also be a good way to deal with the bullying and confidence issues without being overtly obvious. I know that I was often annoyed when I was given books that directly addressed the issue rather than books that happened to include the issue (namely about periods since I got mine incredibly early).   This is also a good way to naturally talk about issues )and build her reading comprehension up. After you finish a chapter, you can talk about certain parts and let her lead the conversation. Then the next night you can ask what she remembers and fill in any gaps that she might have missed. If I remember correctly, too, the first couple of books have picture books more suitable for a bedtime story vibe.",

It has really helped me alot. There is \"shoe dog, by Phil Knight, Steve Jobs by Isaacson, Into the wild.( but in general every book has th to offer, that makes us to search for sth more than ourselves) Starting my day with some of these reads, gives a headstart to my day, i am not in that negative mindset, so a little more confident. Its still hard for me to express myself but i know thats a great start.

The negative comments I hear about this book are because the tactics are often used by sales people to seem friendly and caring to improve their chances of making a sale. So I would recommend that you use the tips genuinely and not to try and sell someone something.",

It is a self-help book for people suffering from depression. Chapter 11 is titled The Approval Addiction and chapter 12 is titled The Love Addiction, so it does address some of the problems you are having. I read the book and its sequel Feeling Great when I was in a period of severe depression, and, much to my surprise, it changed my life immensely. It may help you as well. Since it's a self-help book, you will get the most out of it by doing the exercises.  If you read one chapter in this book and aren't interested, I think you can take a lot of pride in saying that you at least tried. Please continue to be resourceful. Other self-help books that deal with cognitive-behavioral therapy may help you.",

Highly recommend The Practicing Stoic.   Jocko Willinck has a couple good books on the topic of discipline.  As with all things though, it's practice. There is no smoking gun, no book, no new concept to understand. You already have what it takes. (I say this as a man who has to remind himself these things DAILY).",

Second, literature is amazing and can probably help, but it’s not everything and certainly won’t substitute things like therapy or meditation. Third, i haven’t been where you’ve been, so i’m gonna recommend some books but my life experience has been drastically different from yours. Forth, i’m not entirely sure if you’re looking for fiction or self-help-y non-fiction, so i’ll recommend a couple of both.   Man’s Search for Meaning, by Victor Frankl, and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius are both non-fiction books that have helped a lot of people. The Frankl one is about controlling what you can and searching for meaning in your life; he wrote it based largely off his experiences having survived  a Nazi death camp in WW2. Meditations is more a stoic text that focuses on living a virtuous life and developing self discipline to gain control over your own judgements and desires. Both have helped a lot of people.   for fiction i’ll recommend two books: Becky Chambers’s A Psalm for the Wind Built, and Heningway’s The Old Man and the Sea.   Psalm is a very quiet, contemplative journey of a non-binary person finding their way in a strange future world. i found it to be like reading a hug i didn’t know i needed. it’s one of those books where you end up feeling like…everything will be okay. Old Man follows a poor cuban fisherman who is just…the coolest person ever. he struggles through a crazy story and is just…always clear on what needs to be done and accepts his position without judgment, and with a clear understanding of where he’s at and what needs to happen next. it’s…strangely inspiring.   anyways, i hope you find what you need. good luck.",

Patrick Teahan on YouTube has been very helpful for me and my current boyfriend, who also grew up in an abusive and neglectful household. CPTSD can be hard to work with and a trauma-informed therapist is essential. I had to pinpoint what my triggers were specifically to be able to read and work with workbooks—mine were abandonment trauma and trust issues due to emotional and physical neglect. There are workbooks for these and it has been incredibly helpful for me. I'm 90% less reactive than I use to be and I have learned how to communicate my needs and feelings in a healthy manner.",

The Man’s Guide to Women by John Gottman (if you are male). The Joy of Sex and Our Bodies, Ourselves if you are female. These are old books and probably available used for not much money. Many may be in the library. I have not read this one myself, but I have heard it recommended : The Little Book of Big Change: The No-Willpower Approach to Breaking Any Habit. by Johnson and Howard.

Dont get me wrong little tips or anecdotes can change ones perspective too but relating to some character can have a greater impact whether fiction or non. For a fiction, I really enjoyed King Rat by James Clavell, it definitely would evoke some feelings about both. Tons of biographies and many war books show willpower, discipline etc.",

It's neither simplistic, repetitive or obvious. It also doesn't promise a magic bullet.  *A Liberated Mind* by Steven Hayes is a self-help book describing Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). I'm reading it right now and finding it very helpful. The recommendations are backed up by research. It's not really about willpower/self-discipline, but it is about how to live in a way that matches your values, which surely is the point of willpower/self-discipline.",

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results. > >If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights. > >Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field. > >Learn how to: >- Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); >- Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; >- Design your environment to make success easier; >- Get back on track when you fall off course; >...and much more. > >Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.  ^(This book has been suggested 13 times)  ***  ^(26778 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him \"The Fittest (Real) Man in America.\"   In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",

Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance.

Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night.

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.

We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Bren頂rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.  ^(This book has been suggested 99 times)  ***  ^(128692 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

Stanley McChrystal - my share of the task (Army not Navy but still relevant)   Adm. William McRaven - make your bed.    All of these books will speak about leadership. It takes discipline to be a good leader, along with a lot of other intangibles.  If you're looking to develop the mental fortititide to develop discipline you have to factor in things like:  Resiliance   Self - awareness  Good routine and habits  All of that blends together. Most of what the SEALs do isn't about discipline per se, so much as it is a focused mindset.  Here are some tangential books that aren't about SEALs but might help you get where you're going:   Eric Greitens - resiliance how to live a better life    Mithu Storoni - stress proof   Mark Golsten - get out of your own way   Steven Covey - the 7 habits of highly effective people   Ilja Grzeskowitz - the change maker mindset   Richard O'Connor - rewire   Gary John Bishop - stop doing that shit (not my favorite but it gets the point across)  Cheers",

The latter is an insanely detailed structural analysis of the narrative components or “codes” of the said novella. (Admittedly, Barthes’ text does have some theoretical flaws; nonetheless, it’s a groundbreaking analysis, showing readers, critics, writers how to actively engage with the formal elements of a narrative.) The novella itself is a delight to read!",

The novel focuses on the midlife crisis of the main character, Ilya Ilyich Oblomov, an upper middle class son of a member of Russia's nineteenth century landed gentry. Oblomov's distinguishing characteristic is his slothful attitude towards life. While a common negative characteristic, Oblomov raises this trait to an art form, conducting his little daily business apathetically from his bed.  > >While clearly comedic, the novel also seriously examines many critical issues that faced Russian society in the nineteenth century. Some of these problems included the uselessness of landowners and gentry in a feudal society that did not encourage innovation or reform, the complex relations between members of different classes of society such as Oblomov's relationship with his servant Zakhar, and courtship and matrimony by the elite.  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  ***  ^(41934 books suggested | )^(Bug?

My partner watched the series and I believe she struggles to read it easily but she still finds it interesting as it’s a new perspective almost (the feelings and thoughts etc expressed whereas in the series you can’t really see or hear this). However when I speak to her of some scenes, she says that they’re different in the books, which is interesting. Also, apparently after book 4 out of 7 (soon to be 8), it goes away from the story that is shown in the series. All together, maybe it’d be interesting to see a different perspective and maybe different twists to the story.",

Here are a few uplifting fiction recs with strong mental health themes:  ✅ **Turtles All the Way Down** by John Green – A YA novel that beautifully captures OCD and anxiety with sensitivity and hope. It’s introspective but ultimately heartening.  ✅ **The Perks of Being a Wallflower** by Stephen Chbosky – A coming-of-age story that deals with trauma, friendship, and healing. Emotional but very affirming.  ✅ **Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine** by Gail Honeyman – A quirky, surprisingly feel-good adult novel about loneliness, social anxiety, and human connection.  ✅ **Finding Audrey** by Sophie Kinsella – A light and funny YA read that handles anxiety and recovery with warmth and humor.  ✅ **I Was Born for This** by Alice Oseman – A must if you liked relatable, heartfelt narratives with mental health at the core and positive vibes throughout.  Hope something in here clicks with you! 😊📚",

She is a NYT journalist that was diagnosed with CPTSD and she writes about the various treatment methods she tried and her experiences navigating America’s MH system. She talks to a few specialists in various domains of mental healthcare about their fields. She talks about medications, various therapies (usually with a focus on trauma focused treatments), yoga, meditation, religion, diet, exercise, genetics, the default network mode. She intellectualised her diagnosis and combined with her passion for journalism it led to a really unique book on mental health.  It’s about her lived experience of childhood trauma and generational trauma, so trigger warnings might be worth looking into. It’s not focused on depression as that’s not her diagnosis, but she writes very eloquently and she cites all the studies she refers to throughout the book.",

        "text": "I am not a romance reader but here are books with romance as a main element that I LOVED (all of them have fantasy elements but they are not fantasy like LOTR). All are light hearted and perfect for escaping. No spice.  Half a Soul - incredible prose, best male romantic lead I have ever read, most unique female lead - witty, clever, endearing characters, funny - my only criticism is that it wasn't 2000 pages long because I couldn't get enough!  Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Fairies - feels like reading a fairy tale. Second best male and female lead. She is so grumpy, he is so dramatic. They make an amazing comedic duo. The world feels rich and vibrant and I really wanted to walk through a winter forest after reading it.  Legends and Lattes - romance is more of a subplot, but it's a great little read. A weary adventurer settles down after years of fighting and traveling to open a café. Her charming new assistant is a great help. A sweet little book about finding your own cozy place in the world even if everyone else says they know better what is right for you.   Cursed Cocktails - a retired mage opens a bar to honor his late father, making unexpected friends and allies along the way.   A Marvelous Light - this one feels a little different from the others. It's a murder mystery with some darker elements, but overall still a lighthearted book. I was in a similar situation like you and could relate a lot to one of the male leads. At its core it's about meeting society's and your family's expectations, or failing to do so, finding strength in your weaknesses and in other people, if you let them into your heart. This one in spicy! But it's all very sweet and consensual, no weird dubious consent situations that ruin most spicy books for me.  Edit: OH GOD FINALLY someone who also hated Normal People. The leads were insufferable and the prose felt like a constant run on sentence that lasted like 200 pages.",

I am going to recommend both anyway.   Heated Rivalry by Rachel Reid: Shane and Ilya are rival hockey players. They start hooking up in a situationship when they are in the same town and the book follows them over 7 years. They fall in love through sex. So there are a ton of sex scenes which I know isn't for everyone.   The Long Game by Rachel Reid: takes place three years after Heated Rivalry ends. Shane and Ilya are a couple in the closet and playing for different teams. Ilya struggles with depression and seeks therapy.   It sounds cheesy, and the first one definitely is a bit cheesy. But it's incredibly well done.",

She wasn”t keen at first as she is quite shy and introverted, but now loves it as the ladies all chat as a group before class. I think classes offered at community centres are more likely to have other women your Mom”s age vs. 20 year olds. I tried to get my Mom into other hobby classes there but apart from one painting class that was a bust.  Is there anyone in her life she could have a mini- book club with to co-read and maybe enjoy a chat about the books?   It”s tough to see our Moms struggle, best wishes.",

I used to read 90 books a year, and then hit a wall for 4 years where I read maybe 1 book each year. Depression, anxiety, and life changes got in the way. I’ve gotten back into it this year, and I really recommend setting a timer for 10 minutes and just reading any book you want. Whether it’s a reread of something you love, or a book you’ve meaning to read for awhile. Just force yourself to sit and read for those 10 mins. When the timer goes off, you can stop. But if you want to keep going, you can. I had to do that earlier this year to get back into it, and now I’m back to reading 4-5 books per month. It’s helped, and I hope you can get back to doing something you enjoy despite the inner turmoil going on in your mind.",

(When a bite of pickle is a luxury, my own circumstances are…just fine, actually.)  Another fun one is “Forever Amber” a sort-of romance featuring Amber, irrepressible and ambitious in 1660s England. It’s not super raunchy but Amber is prone to affairs and marriages despite always wanting to be with her first love. It’s fun to root for Amber even when she does dumb stuff!  When my Grandma was quite blind, I got her a little Walkman (yes, was a while ago) with audiobooks of All Creatures Great And Small. Nothing raunchier than small dogs stuck together, and having a warm friendly voice telling stories, I thought, would be a comfort. Grandma hated it and used it for listening to cowboy music, so your mileage will vary.  Also, tell her I say hi! I’m 60+, freshly divorced and in a new place, too; plus the depression and anxiety are imperfectly controlled with drugs. It took about a year of dragging myself to coffee shops, used book stores, and garage sales before I finally stopped emitting social anxiety like a pigpen cloud.  I wish her good luck in getting out there! It helps!",

He does attempt to end his life fyi but it's not gruesome, more despondent. A young family moves in and starts interacting with him, and he also begrudgingly acquires a cat. It flashes between present day and his early years meeting his wife. Very poignant and ultimately hopeful, finding a new lease in life in his later years. There are two film adaptations, one in Swedish with the same title and more recently A Man Called Otto with Tom Hanks.   Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. It has three perspectives - an elderly woman whose son was lost at sea, she works cleaning the aquarium. A young man (maybe 20s?) who is drifting through life and launches a poorly organized journey to discover who his father is. And Marcellus, an octopus at the aquarium who routinely sneaks out of his tank and forms a friendship with the woman.",

Funny, short books that are easy reads.     Beyond these books about life, I also find myself reaching for books from my childhood when I’m in a low moment.

        "text": "The Daevabad Trilogy by S.A. Chakraborty - There is some romance but it tends to be in the backseat of a \"normal\" girl thrown into a new magical world to face political machinations, cycles of revenge, and dark conspiracy.  The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi, also by S.A. Chakraborty - Intended as a trilogy but the first book stands quite well on its own. The focus is far more on audacious adventure and found family, as a pirate captain takes on \"one last job.\"  The Discworld series by Terry Prachett - Clever, funny series that poke fun of all manner of pop culture and media from Conan the Barbarian to Phantom of the Opera to Shakespeare. He has quite a bibliography, which can seem intimidating, but there are suggested reading order guides everywhere. You may like starting with the Tiffany Aching books, which are about a girl coming of age as a witch. Her first book involves her daring to go into a different dimension to rescue her baby brother from the Queen of the Fairies.",

A girl's father is the one who lays the undead to rest, in a kingdom where there is a wonderfully built magical system. He goes missing, she goes looking. YA.   * Tress of the Emerald Sea by Sanderson. Very different from Mistborn, almost dreamy or like a fairytale. While it is a love story... the point is the story.    Sci-Fi that reads like Fantasy:   * Red Rising: Hunger Games meets Mistborn meets Ender's Game? In a world of stratified societies, a lowly born kid is made a hero. This series is SO good.   * Cinder: steampunk Cinderella? It works.",

It follows a 'rogues-for-hire' duo in a classic-feeling fantasy world, who take on a job and are pulled into something much bigger than they were expecting. It starts fairly lighthearted/low-stakes, but grows to become quite an epic story, with tons of great characters, fun banter, excellent worldbuilding, twists and revelations, and adventure. The first book is Theft of Swords (The Crown Conspiracy/Avempartha), and if you enjoy it the author has written a number of excellent prequel series set in the same world that you can check out after Revelations (Legends of the First Empire, Riyria Chronicles, and The Rise and Fall).   the **Cradle** series by Will Wight is another good one. In a very magic-filled world, Lindon is forbidden to study the 'sacred arts' of his clan, and must forge his own path.  Tons of great magic/powers, interesting and unique world building, great characters and adventure.  Fast-paced and entertaining fantasy, there are 13 books total and basically no romance/sex. The first book is Unsouled.  You might like **The Wheel of Time** by Robert Jordan as well. Classic epic fantasy with a huge world and tons of interesting characters, lots of magic and deep world building. A big influence on Sanderson and others. The first book is The Eye of the World.",

It's not for someone who might not have a firm foundation to their healing yet.",

        "text": "How young? There are a lot of really great middle grade books out there exploring so many topics in really lovely ways. I would go to your local public library and ask for help finding some on your topics. Thought of this because I was going through the list of books I read and came across *King and the Dragonflies* by Kacen Callender, which is a middle grade book about a 7th grade boy who's gay and brother just died navigating grief, a home environment where he doesn't feel like he can come out, and his friend who ran away due to his abusive dad finding out that he (the friend) is also gay. In it, parents and adults make it safe for the kid to come home, but along the way there's also really powerful exploration of youth and grief as well as identity.  In terms of book recommendations, I haven't read much at all that might fit in this category and I don't know think my suggestions are going to be any good especially with a concern towards age appropriateness, but here's a few that might help as a starting place. Just as a note, I definitely mainly read female authors and female POV books. - *Hundred Thousand Kingdoms* by NK Jemisin. I'm including it because it has a subplot with a woman (main character) refusing to perpetuate the sexual assault of a boy (he's actually a God and can make himself look any age, but views himself as a child, so she's acting to protect him). Adult aimed fantasy trilogy. - *Fifth Season* by NK Jemisin has an adult male with a history of (reading between the lines as far as I can remember) being abused that the woman main character protects against. Another adult aimed fantasy trilogy, but probably good for older teens - *Almond* by Woo-pyung Sohn is about a teen boy with dulled emotions. No abuse (though, there is a couple of violent scenes), but it's about navigating empathy and has positive female and male figures (though also enabling parental figures who he loves). Probably more age appropriate. Translated from Korean",

I wouldn't be surprised if people are hesitant to mention potential books both because there aren't that many, but also because they are worried that they might mention something that could cause further trauma.",

It's mostly memoirs, but there's probably some promising things in there. I also just found a Goodreads list titled \"Sexual Violence Against Men in Fiction\" that purports to be created by a survivor, so it might lead to some good options.  I think the lack of response is due to not having readily available resources. Are there any elements you would love to see in terms of fiction that aren't necessarily topic specific? Like, PTSD or overcoming trust issues or something? I think if there were broader topics to respond to, folks might feel like they have more recommendations. Since there is so little public discourse on the topic, there might be less knowledge on opportunities for where related but not exact books could come into play.",

The rest are good for people but it's not our focus.  We've got some of their stuff on our lists but we're looking for more. A lot more. We've seen women's center's reading lists and they're massive in comparison.

I think if there were broader topics to respond to, folks might feel like they have more recommendations. Since there is so little public discourse on the topic, there might be less knowledge on opportunities for where related but not exact books could come into play.  In fiction there is a notable example that we latched onto. If you've ever seen any Star Trek show you may see where I'm going with this. In the second series called The Next Generation the captain, Picard, has an emotional breakdown in front of his brother over the trauma of what a hivemind race called the Borg did to him, what they forced him to do (helped in part that they're led by a queen). Everything about it resonated with us. The trauma responses, the things said when he broke down, the anger and hate he has for them. All of it felt familiar. It's not sexual trauma but it works as a parallel. That kind of story element would work.  So this is why I included fiction too. Frankly I'm hoping to pad out the list with a lot of this. Stories in fiction inspire and inform so I hope to find some to hand out.",

It talks about where those feelings come from, specific things you can do and work towards instead, and just a lot of empowerment in your experiences which I found helpful. Whether or not you have experiences with this in your childhood, it’s mainly about the emotions that come from family dysfunction and it’s a really good CPTSD book if you’re interested!",

It's somehow worse when it's someone you considered a friend because the trust was there. I had a situation with someone at work who I considered a friend and mentor so it took me a very long time to realize that she was actually a sabotaging bully who felt threatened. I bet this is what's going on with this person, she feels the need to sabotage you and tank your reputation because she's threatened by you.  Just know that someone like this was **never really your friend** \\- you were of use to them in a certain capacity and now for some reason you are a threat. It could have been as innocuous as someone complimenting your work for her to flip the switch into mean girl. remember NOTHING you did or didn't do or said or didn't say caused this switch.",

It’s Chapter 5: The Coldest Hart but it will make more sense with the context and background given in the other chapters.   They have another book *Born For Love* which is all about how people develop empathy starting in infancy and how that process can be derailed. So it’s not specifically focused on sociopaths, but sociopathy is characterized by lack of empathy and conscience so it’s very much related. There’s a whole spectrum of case studies from a girl adopted from a neglectful Romanian orphanage to a teenage rapist.",

I guess some books on psychopathy could be enlightening to the full spectrum in talking about the childhoods of serial killers, but for this lane of learning, I don't want to focus on the spectacle of famous serial killers, I want to really drill down on the anthropological side of why humans take pleasure in the suffering of other humans in all its forms.

They are exploring the behaviors of those disorders and how they appear in everyday people. Those everyday people aren’t serial killers or diagnosed psychopaths. They are people with the behaviors that have figured out how to make it work for them.   For example: the book I suggested the author is a neuroscientist who didn’t have any idea he was a psychopath until he scanned his brain. He then goes back and explores his last behaviors which include being a horrible husband, abusing alcohol and drugs, cheating, etc. the signs were there but seen as him just being a crappy person. On the outside he was, as you said you wanted, an everyday person that had what you are describing as sadistic personality traits.

So many factors effect the way we behave. Maybe you should look into the concept of morality and how researchers have determined what causes us to act in \"moral\" ways during certain parts of our lives. It seems like you're essentially interested in when people are \"immoral\" to some degree. For developmental, I remember Kohlbergs model of moral development to be the main one we learned in school. That's focused on the reasons or pressures people follow or break rules basically.   As a trained therapist though, I'm not sure you could point to one or two things and say this is why someone behaves a certain way. As I mentioned, it's a complex issue but the most studied behaviors are going to be the extremes.",

Actually there is more to life than we think.. generally we are stuck in a thought and reel through it as it is the truth and only way.. which results in depression. If we can open ourselves up and see how we can be helpful for others lot can change. One book that really helped me to step up is \" who will cry when you die\" by robin sharma  And All Art of Living books or meditation or talks in youtube has also helped me immensely to bring my life to right track.",

But all 5 are good, especially if you want therapy for trauma.  The books are YA fantasies, and could technically be classified as Romantasies but I personally think there is so much more to all of them then just the love story.  I don't want to spoil anything but my favourite scene, and the one that gave me the most healing is from Winterkeep. To characters are talking about the first once abuse at the hand of her mother.  Second character ask where first characters father is in all this. First character: \"He would let me into his library and give me hot chocolate. When mother came pounding at the door, he would open it and tell her that he was handling it. Then he would let me stay in the library till mother called dinner.\"  Second Character: \" What happened when she called dinner?\"  First character \" we would go downstairs and Mother would make me stand in front of me seat, with my plate of food there. She would tell me all the things I did wrong. Then she would slap my for being a horrible child, and send me up to the attic room and lock me in there to learn my lesson.\"  Second character : \" What did your father do then?\"  First character \"Well, nothing. He could never calm mother when she got like that.\"  Second character: \" so he did nothing while your mother hurt you? Just stood by and watched? Why is he the better parent? He did nothing to stop her.\"  And then first character has the realization that her father was complicit in her abuse.     I'm paraphrasing, because I don't have a physical copy of the book ATM. But all of her books are like that. The main character is struggling and they just meet people who peper wisdom and realism of their trauma onto them. Putting things into perspective and helping them heal. They're wonderful.",

I've read that you don't want fantasy, but maybe you can try Terry Pratchett's Guards sub-cycle of The Discworld?  I promise that the dragons are just props, and it's entirely about what being a human being means. His books are brilliant and more serious than a lot of contemporary literature.",

        "text": "Books that don’t feel like fiction:  “The Good Earth” by Pearl S Buck. If you are interested in history or China it is a masterpiece  “Shogun” a perfect work of historical fiction about an English sailor who lands in early Japan. (Tw - starts with a scene of pretty awful violence)  “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian” (partially autobiographical, with hilarious illustrations), YA (tw - traumatic childhood)  “The Hate U Give” (YA) a black girl growing up in a wonderful supportive family witnessed her friend getting shot, and has to deal with the social ramifications  If you’d like a mystery:  “The Dry” or “The Lost Man” by Jane Harper. Both take place in the deserts of Australia and involve family drama/trauma. (tw - traumatic childhood)  If you’d like a historical fiction YA book that’s will make you feel better:  “The War that Saved my Life” about a girl and her brother who were evacuated from London during WWII, from an abusive home to a kind home.  If you’d like a book that’s YA and a little harder to make sense of (like a puzzle) until it all becomes clear:  “Challenger Deep” by Neil Schusterman. A gentle book About a boy dealing with the beginnings of schizophrenia.   More fictional books:  “Circe” is really good book about loneliness that is fiction because it is about Gods and Goddesses of Greece, but is more focused on emotions. Slow and deep.  “The Girl with all the Gifts” - an intellectual zombie story that reads like a fast-paced first person story. Hard to put down!  “The Bone Clocks” really a series of short stories all tied together by how the characters are related to each other and how they deal with these evil humans who are acting like psychic vampires. Amazing book. Audio book is even better. To see if you’d like it read the short story version “Slade House”.  Anything by Octavia Butler. It’s speculative fiction but they don’t feel like fantasy/sci-fi. They are focused on the characters and their relationships, and especially on power dynamics in society.  Extremely Fiction  “Gideon the Ninth” this book has people who had no happy childhoods, but is amazingly well written. The tagline is “lesbian necromancers in space”, but it’s more about the relationship between two women who fucking hate each other and are trying to get away from each other.  “Shades of Grey” by Jasper Fforde my favorite dystopia! About a boy who lives in a world where your status is determined by by how much color you can see. He falls in love with a grey, a lowest class woman, who shows him more than he wanted to see about his society. Makes you think about a lot of things in new ways.",

It’s not just motivational fluff it actually gives you a new way of looking at things and pushes you to take real action. Some parts really made me stop and reflect, and others just lit a fire under me. If you’re in that phase where you want to level up but don’t know exactly how, this book might help give you some clarity.",

Great messages, but I don’t think the book adds anything to them that aren’t better presented by a couple of his YouTube speeches back in 2018. There are probably better options out there.  I would also strongly caution any 17 year old from consuming JBP content without a huge grain of salt. He’s a daily wire mouthpiece and called a doctor a criminal for performing a common elective surgery on a consenting adult. As someone who got sucked into JBP content when I was 16, I think it probably held me back if anything.",

From what you wrote, it sounds like you're feeling like you should have achieved more by now and for whatever reason you've decided that this is all about money. Have you thought that it might just be about your hopes and dreams in general?   How would you feel about reading some books on basic philosophy instead? Now, as with get rich books, there are many different philosophies, a lot of them contradictory. But philosophy can be a fascinating dive into the human psyche rather than a guarantee of success (like get rich books) so you never really feel like you've failed, just learned a bit more about yourself.  I would start with something easy like **The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho** which is a novel but touches on many ideas about what we want from life. But if you want to go hard core into philosophy, watch The Good Place first as it will introduce you to many different philosophical ideas and philosophers.  Good luck!",

        "text": "I usually start with goodreads to check reviews, I also give bonus points for highly educated authors writing about their specialty. By that same token the more educated the author is but the further from their specialty the books is about throws massive red flags.   Once I find a book I like I usually go to the library and do a skim read of it based on the system in How to Read a Book by Adler. Then I try and find the top 2-3 YouTubers in the same topic space and look for any common assertions, theories or methodologies. Often this is as far as I go with the book and start my own research/learning. Then when(if) I read the book again I can check the commonalities and differences in the book. Lastly I try to find research, data, evidence that supports the authors claims. This is obviously easier if the book has a references or further reading section.    Generally the more you read the easier it is to determine the trustworthiness of the author. So any reading is beneficial if it helps you refine your BS detector. I also like using the libraries for recommendations either through the displays or by asking librarians as they typically don't receive money based on which book you read and therefore less biased than Steve the YouTuber trying to get affiliate commission.    I also keep in mind that the author wants you to buy their book and enjoy the process of reading it so you buy more of their books. Also keep survivorship bias in mind, people that succeed at their goals often write books about how they did it but rarely make reference to how much luck played a part in their success. 100 people all try to get rich using the same method and only one of them succeeds but writes a book about how they used that method they might fail to mention or just not know/realize that method has a 1% success rate.    Based on your reading list it seems you are interested in personal finance in which case I can recommend the Money Guys Financial Order of Operations as a good Baseline to check any other finance book against. If the book is recommending anything that directly contradicts the FOO then it has to have a really good reason for it.",

I would start with the book called Attached.   I think a lot of self exploration would help. also working on with thing at a time. Therapy has helped me immensely. I have not read the book “Let Them” but it has a lot of positive reviews and might also be helpful.   Also look for something revolving around your sense of identity and figuring out who you are.   I struggled a lot with my sense of justice. If something was wrong especially when it did not involve me (I have a hard time sticking up for myself) but for those I love I have this NEED to right a wrong or stick up for that person who maybe can’t stick up for themselves. a lot of people hate this about me and I hate it about myself. I’ve cried about how life would be so much easier if I just moved on and didn’t care so much. and my therapist just said The world needs people like you.   The world most likely needs people like you too, unless you are a murderer or pedo haha.   I also struggle with whether or not I care about keeping up with the joneses. I don’t but then I care that I don’t care haha. it’s my shame. like i’m not put together I don’t drove the best car i’m not the best looking I don’t like keeping up with the news. I don’t enjoy a lot of what other people enjoy and I carry shame around that, but we’ve explored does it really matter? and just keep asking why after every answer. and in the end I think about those around me that love/enjoy me. They’re who matter most. there’s so much more to this but I won’t waste your time haha.   and then the 100% rule no one can be 100% at everything. Like i’m messy and i’m a little uptight with my kids sometimes, but i’m also fun, I provide them with emotional intelligence and a safe space as well as good recovery, yes I lose my cool but I do all of these other things. and the little things count too. like I make good cookies. maybe someone has a clean home and provides a safe space but they make gross cookies. no one can be 100% at everything. everyone is different.   sorry you’re going through this. I know I didn’t give you perfect recommendations, but maybe that will give you a jumpstart.   DEFINITELY do NOT read books like Girl wash your face or other influencer-type books. a lot of them have that toxic positivity. The goal is to understand yourself first before accepting yourself. good luck! I hope you feel better and find a way to love yourself wholly! i’m still working on it. it takes time!",

        "text": "I mean, it’s hard for me to judge what’s an appropriate book for that age and set of circumstances. I’m pretty far removed from being that age myself and I read a lot of weird stuff at that age ranging from books geared towards 12 year olds up to Shakespeare, and J.D Salinger. When I was a few years older than him I found a lot of comfort and relatability in Catcher in the Rye. In my adult years I found two books I wish I had had around that age because they focus on coming of age as a young man in your teenage years, and both books I found deeply moving and relatable. Those two books are The Perks Of Being A Wallflower and All The Pretty Horses.   Some spoilers in the name of content warnings follow. While all three books are about young boys/ men coming of age around the 15/18 year old range, the subject matter in them is heavy.   All three touch on the subject matter of sexual assault/rape/molestation, and the trauma brought about by it. All The Pretty Horses is the lightest on that particular subject probably as it is mostly implied it happens to side characters in prison.  Catcher contains a scene of underage drinking and attempted solicitation of a prostitute.  Perks has whole chapters and side stories that are probably dicey for a lot of people, like him helping his older sister with getting an abortion in secret and wanting to protect her from her abusive boyfriend, or a whole chunk of time him and his gay best friend are somewhat socially ostracized and go through a phase of underage drinking and him tagging along with his gay friend “cruising” for sex, and also a bit of experimenting himself.    As for violence Perks and Catcher both have scenes of what amounts to emotional fistfights that wrap up quickly. All The Pretty Horses goes quite a bit further. There’s a lot of murder. Mostly by corrupt law enforcement or prisoners in a prison. There’s knife fights and shoot outs. A wonderul chapter where an older woman of importance recounts her young years and her lover who was involved in the revolution and was later quite literally torn apart by a mob of people. None of it is glorified. It’s in fact quite surreal and horrific and the MC is left mentally damaged by even the actions he takes out of pure self defense.   While all that subject matter may be heavy, life is also heavy. I found it nice to have characters I could relate to who were also going through it. My life at that age felt like a literal nightmare I felt like I couldn’t escape from sometimes. My family was fucked up and, things were very hard.   Even as an adult I found a lot of empowerment after reading Perks of Being a Wallflower and it related back to my teenage and early adult experiences better than probably anything I’ve ever read. I think thats the one I would go with. It’s specifically about what it’s like to go through the high school experience. It shows that even a good kid with a loving family can be struggling dealing with past trauma while trying to find his way in life. It’s brutally honest and it pulls no punches. The ending is uplifting and hopeful, though devastatingly emotional as well. I remember seeing the movie in theaters with my older sister after reading the book. By the time the credits rolled my sister and I were both bawling our eyes out and turned to see the ENTIRE theater breaking down crying including a big tough body builder looking guy behind me I kind of just wanted to give a hug to. It’s really really good is my point. I’m gonna be a bit to personal here probably and say that this book and movie actually had a profound impact on me as the year of my life in which I discovered the book was one of the worst. I was at rock bottom, borderline homeless, just out of a terrible toxic relationship, and had developed an addiction to pills and alcohol to numb the pain or life and trauma I had experienced in my teen years. I found this book sitting on my best friends book shelf, I was crashing on her couch at the time, and I was compelled to pick it up and read it. This book did more for my mental health than 3 different therapists and a psychologist could ever begin to. Another book I’m remembering from that period of my life that helped immensely and now that I think about it is another great novel I could suggest would be The Life of Pi.   All these books may have heavy subjects but they also have so much beauty and so much truth about the world and people and our human nature in them. As a fan of poetry I have to say All The Pretty Horses has some of the most beautifully poetic passages I’ve ever read anywhere. It is also like 25% hard untranslated Spanish, so it’s also a bit of a fun learning activity if you’re Spanish isn’t that great lol.   Anyways sorry for rambling forever I hope any of these sound like good suggestions.",

        "text": "Here are a few books that have made a real difference for me and might offer you some valuable insights and strategies:  [\"The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem\"](https://amzn.to/42VQQcM) by Nathaniel Branden - This book dives deep into what self-esteem really is and how to build it from the ground up. Branden breaks it down into six practices that you can work on, like living consciously and self-acceptance. It's a bit of a read, but it's packed with exercises and practical advice that can make a big difference.  [\"Daring Greatly\"](https://amzn.to/3UUwwH8) by Brené Brown - Brené Brown talks about vulnerability and how it's actually a strength, not a weakness. Her book really changed the way I look at myself and my interactions with others. It's about embracing who you are, flaws and all, and stepping into the world with more courage and confidence.  [\"Feel the Fear ... and Do It Anyway\"](https://amzn.to/3IcLY9L) by Susan Jeffers - This book is a classic for a reason. It's all about facing the fears that hold you back and developing the confidence to get past them. Jeffers provides practical tools and exercises to help you change your mindset and take control of your life.  [\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\"](https://amzn.to/3OWmOQp) by Carol S. Dweck - Dweck introduces the concept of \"fixed\" vs. \"growth\" mindsets and how they impact our lives, including our self-esteem. Understanding that abilities and intelligence can be developed was a game-changer for me. It's a powerful read that can help you see challenges in a new light and boost your confidence in learning and growing.  [\"Unfu\\*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and into Your Life\"](https://amzn.to/3TcZtNa) by Gary John Bishop - If you're looking for something more straightforward, this book cuts right to the chase. It's a no-nonsense guide to getting over your mental hurdles and taking action towards the life you want. It's motivating and can give you that kick to start making changes.  Each of these books offers something unique, from understanding the foundations of self-esteem to practical steps for building confidence and facing fears. It's okay to feel stuck sometimes, but with the right tools and a bit of effort, you can move forward. I hope these books help you as much as they've helped me. Hang in there, and remember that seeking help is a huge step forward in itself.",

Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men* by Lundy Bancroft - I honestly consider this a must read for any woman that’s been in an abusive relationship, just very eye-opening; can be heavy though so be prepared  *Set Boundaries, Find Peace: A Guide to Reclaiming Yourself* by Nedra Glover Tawwab - I really liked the way this book laid out the research within this area and gave practical ways of learning to set needed boundaries even in difficult situations (this author has another book called *Drama Free* that’s also really good!)  *Radical Acceptance* by Tara Brach - radical acceptance can be such a difficult thing for people to manage but it can honestly help with self-esteem so much by teaching us how to accept all parts of ourselves (sounds kinda silly, I know, but it’s really helpful when applied right)  *The Gifts of Imperfection* by Brene Brown - honestly this author is kind of a go-to when talking about self-esteem, guilt, and shame; super approachable book with good research and can definitely make you feel seen (if you like her writing I would suggest checking out her other stuff as well!)  *The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma* by Bessel van der Kolk - the is basically the Bible when it comes to trauma books; very well researched and really good applications for healing; can be heavy though so make sure you’re in a good place when tackling it!  Sorry for such a long and wordy post, but these are all books that came to mind when I read your post so I wanted to give you a lot of options! I hope some of these can be helpful for you!",

Notes On A Nervous Planet is also an easy read and it’s something that you can return back to if you are struggling to finish books at the moment.  I also found listening to audio books helped. I struggle with sleeping, so I found listening to Harry Potter (particularly as I know the books so well it doesn’t matter if I’m not fully listening or drift off) before bed helps distracts my mind from going over everything.",

We are led to believe that if we could only look perfect and lead perfect lives, we'd no longer feel inadequate. So most of us perform, please, and perfect, all the while thinking, What if I can't keep all of these balls in the air? Why isn't everyone else working harder and living up to my expectations? What will people think if I fail or give up? When can I stop proving myself?In The Gifts of Imperfection, Bren頂rown, PhD, a leading expert on shame, authenticity and belonging, shares what she's learned from a decade of research on the power of Wholehearted Living--a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.In her ten guideposts, Brown engages our minds, hearts, and spirits as she explores how we can cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think, No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough, and to go to bed at night thinking, Yes, I am sometimes afraid, but I am also brave. And, yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable, but that doesn't change the truth that I am worthy of love and belonging.  ^(This book has been suggested 27 times)  ***  ^(65393 books suggested | )^(Bug?

Some people in there who recommend {12 Rules for Life} by Jordan Peterson. Disregarding anything political about him, this is one book I know to be good. It isn’t specifically about self-esteem, but I suspect the best way to get that from a books is for the book to help you understand how to deal with whatever you’re dealing with. That’s something this book does well. It does it with a lot of tangents, yes, but it does it well.  Edit: a word.",

This helped me a lot when I was having confidence issues. Not only do you feel more comfortable verbalizing it, but it helps you really believe it too. I would say things that I knew I would list as strengths in a job interview such as, \"I'm really meticulous in my work and like to make sure that every detail is perfect. I'm great at proof-reading as I have a good eye for mistakes. I'm a good asset to any company because I don't like to be bored, so when I finish my tasks I'm always searching for something else I can do to improve my skills or get an early start on another project.\" I usually did that in the morning, and at night I would focus on other self-things (\"I really liked the way my hair looked today. I'm a good listener.\"). Past this, if you have a friend or family member who would be willing to listen to you brag about yourself, do it! Say the same things you'd say in the mirror to them.

It varies from “The last lecture” in the sense that it’s a bit more about perspective than following the authors story as he works towards his last lecture, but also a good book.",

It also goes against a lot of other self help/motivational books, especially those based on tough love or mental willpower. Her book is about how laziness does not exist, radical self love will help you reach your goals, and you should change your systems to work with you instead of endlessly trying and failing to change yourself to fit the system. It’s basically the opposite of something like Rich Dad Poor Dad or whatever motivational books men read.",

As someone with a STEM job which can be similarly demanding, all I can say is often your performance is based on your environment - if your environment is toxic, you won't be able to perform to your best capabilites while in a more holistic and positive environment you'll see yourself cross your limits and improve more than you expect.   A lot of my peers, who I know to be very smart, underperformed at a company which rhymes with jamazon due to the high pressure and toxic work culture. They outperformed themselves at ambitious startups which had an equally demanding workload but a more positive work culture.",

Both mood-lifting books are by Agatha Christie:  *The Secret of Chimneys*  *Partners in Crime*  My reasoning for these recs is that the books are from the 1920s, and that was a historical time similar to the struggles we're going through now.  I think the toxic environment you describe is incredibly common now, and is a sign of the times.  Escapist books written back then hit the right note to give hope to working age people hit by the challenges of strong global tensions (the 20s were smack in the middle of two world wars), a tech boom (the Industrial Revolution) hitting a wall, multiple pandemics, all on the tail end of a baby boom (the Victorian age), with the resultant effects on the economy.  A lot of stuff from the 1920s - 1940s were cheerful in mood and aimed to help people through those hard times.",

In the end she finds happiness. She does find a partner but it's not about them and it's not about romance. There's also a movie of the same name but I think the book is a bit better.   Adult children of emotionally immature parents - sometimes people who keep choosing difficult people and then trying to make them happy are stuck in patterns of trauma, perhaps stemming from childhood and growing up. If this is you, I think this book might be helpful for you to understand what happened and how to move forward with those parents. Let me know if you'd like more content geared towards this.",

They are human traits and will be easier for some and more difficult for others.   Eckhart Tolle was suicidal, as you may know. I’m aware of at least one other author and teacher that also was suicidal, and I do not recall her name at the moment. These authors enlightenment came through their struggles in a rock-bottom moment.   There are too many authors I’ve read to recall them all at once; so I’ll suggest two: Carl Rogers and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.   This is an area of ongoing practice and please be kind to yourself. Expecting your mind to be quiet and holding that space for an hour when new to the practice is setting oneself up for failure, which in turn will trigger a protective and resistant response from the amygdala. Baby steps. You may gain perspective on this process when viewing how abused horses work through rehabilitation with a competent and compassionate trainer. (I’ll look for a couple books you may like from my list.)  Edits: Norman Doidge, M.D., The Brain’s Way of Healing”  Steven C. Hayes, PhD, “A Liberated Mind”  Daniel G. Amen, M.D., “Feel Better Fast and Make It Last”  John Kim, The Angry Therapist, “I Used to be a Miserable F*ck”  Jeffrey Schwartz, M.D., and Rebecca Gladding, “You Are Not Your Brain”  Dr. Leah Weiss, “How We Work”  Sarah Wilson, “First We Make the Beast Beautiful”  Those should get you started and provide a wide variety of specific directions you may like exploring further.",

Here are a few uplifting fiction recs with strong mental health themes:  ✅ **Turtles All the Way Down** by John Green – A YA novel that beautifully captures OCD and anxiety with sensitivity and hope. It’s introspective but ultimately heartening.  ✅ **The Perks of Being a Wallflower** by Stephen Chbosky – A coming-of-age story that deals with trauma, friendship, and healing. Emotional but very affirming.  ✅ **Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine** by Gail Honeyman – A quirky, surprisingly feel-good adult novel about loneliness, social anxiety, and human connection.  ✅ **Finding Audrey** by Sophie Kinsella – A light and funny YA read that handles anxiety and recovery with warmth and humor.  ✅ **I Was Born for This** by Alice Oseman – A must if you liked relatable, heartfelt narratives with mental health at the core and positive vibes throughout.  Hope something in here clicks with you! 😊📚",

She is a NYT journalist that was diagnosed with CPTSD and she writes about the various treatment methods she tried and her experiences navigating America’s MH system. She talks to a few specialists in various domains of mental healthcare about their fields. She talks about medications, various therapies (usually with a focus on trauma focused treatments), yoga, meditation, religion, diet, exercise, genetics, the default network mode. She intellectualised her diagnosis and combined with her passion for journalism it led to a really unique book on mental health.  It’s about her lived experience of childhood trauma and generational trauma, so trigger warnings might be worth looking into. It’s not focused on depression as that’s not her diagnosis, but she writes very eloquently and she cites all the studies she refers to throughout the book.",

        "text": "I am not a romance reader but here are books with romance as a main element that I LOVED (all of them have fantasy elements but they are not fantasy like LOTR). All are light hearted and perfect for escaping. No spice.  Half a Soul - incredible prose, best male romantic lead I have ever read, most unique female lead - witty, clever, endearing characters, funny - my only criticism is that it wasn't 2000 pages long because I couldn't get enough!  Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Fairies - feels like reading a fairy tale. Second best male and female lead. She is so grumpy, he is so dramatic. They make an amazing comedic duo. The world feels rich and vibrant and I really wanted to walk through a winter forest after reading it.  Legends and Lattes - romance is more of a subplot, but it's a great little read. A weary adventurer settles down after years of fighting and traveling to open a café. Her charming new assistant is a great help. A sweet little book about finding your own cozy place in the world even if everyone else says they know better what is right for you.   Cursed Cocktails - a retired mage opens a bar to honor his late father, making unexpected friends and allies along the way.   A Marvelous Light - this one feels a little different from the others. It's a murder mystery with some darker elements, but overall still a lighthearted book. I was in a similar situation like you and could relate a lot to one of the male leads. At its core it's about meeting society's and your family's expectations, or failing to do so, finding strength in your weaknesses and in other people, if you let them into your heart. This one in spicy! But it's all very sweet and consensual, no weird dubious consent situations that ruin most spicy books for me.  Edit: OH GOD FINALLY someone who also hated Normal People. The leads were insufferable and the prose felt like a constant run on sentence that lasted like 200 pages.",

Diagnosis classically is by taking samples during laparoscopy and having the pathology report confirm endometrial glands found where they don’t belong.  Outside of research centers imaging such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI can’t usually identify these small islands of endometriosis  tissue.  There are no tests so far that can diagnose endometriosis.  The main treatments are hormonal birth control, pain medication, medications to turn off the menstrual cycle (GnRH agonists/antagonists), and surgery.  Surgery is not recommended for diagnosis only, but for persistent symptoms or infertility.  I would have everything you’d like to discuss written down, remain calm and matter of fact, repeat yourself if your question wasn’t answered, and have a goal for the visit, such as one new therapy and close follow-up.  As an aside, Endovan is an herbal supplement available online that has helped some women, and an anti-inflammatory diet can help ease pain from almost any cause.",

You seem very fearful and perhaps caught in a doom spiral. Your primary doctor is giving you vital advice you seem to be having trouble accepting: don’t borrow trouble. Maybe something like a CBT based workbook could help you to manage some of these feelings.

The nature of scientific discovery, including the kinds of philosophy that Sapiens engages in and for physicists like Brian Green, is that there will often be controversies among experts in the field and equally well qualified experts who disagree. This is not a question of ‘alternative facts,’ but of disagreement by experts who favor different hypotheses and for which alternate explanations could be true to explain the same objective data.  The nature of scientific discovery is that we build on prior work and are always investigating new hypotheses. For something to be considered T-true, it must be replicated and demonstrated over and over, sometimes for hundreds of years. And even then, sometimes there are still questions.  We are also always learning more. And so something that was the best hypothesis at the time it was written, can be viewed in a different light as additional information is discovered.  This is the nature of knowledge. It’s constantly evolving as we learn more.",

[fivebooks.com](http://fivebooks.com) can be pretty good for this. As are specialist communities - sometimes you need to dig into old web forums, but often you can find communities here on reddit and then hunt around in their wikis or search for book recommendation threads. Quite a few publications run end-of-year \"best books\" articles that are also often useful in this way.      If you have a particular book in mind and access to academic journals you can also often find reviews even of popular non-fiction by members of the given expert community. Again, specialist communities on reddit can be helpful. E.g. I often chuck: `site:reddit.com \"askhistorians\" \"<name of book>\"` into google when looking for opinions on history books.",

Unfortunately these books often prove popular (and so skew public understanding) because they make bold and maverick statements about their subject; and present the author as some sort of polymath or guru who knows far more than typical.",

When the characters are frightened, anxious, or want to celebrate, they will tell a story to the group. Then as the novel progresses, you see how those stories inspire them to solve problems or rise above challenges.   Yes, there's moments of violence and horror in the book. But there's also moments of great warmth and camaraderie. I reread it every 18 months or so.",

While I agree this book is VERY provocative and can be disturbing, it also does ultimately reconfirm our resiliency, the power of love, and the power of forgiveness.  Other reviews say:  This book destroyed me. I have never read anything like it. I came to the end of the novel with my mind-reeling, my emotions scattered, and completely unsure exactly what I did feel about it...but one thing is certain: I felt. Oh hell, I felt. I don't think I'll ever get these characters off my mind.\" ―Emily May, #1 Worldwide most popular reviewer, Goodreads      \"The title says it all. You will hold your little heart in your hands and keep blowing on it to make sure it's alive.\" ―The Top Ten Hottest Reads of 2016, New York Daily News      \"This is one of those books whose story, if you heard about it on the news or glimpsed some sensationalist headline, would be horrifying, but in THIS book, with THESE characters, where you are privy to interior monologues and backstories and a hundred examples of what defines them as people, it makes sense. It's two damaged people finding something in the other that answers a need, and it's unexpectedly touching. It's so, so impressive.\" ―Karen, #1 US most popular reviewer, Goodreads      \"The stirring Bryn Greenwood’s All the Ugly and Wonderful Things, so freakishly good and dangerous that it should come with a warning label... the writing is direct and muscular, a snake with all the slithery danger of a coiled rattler on a hot rock. VERDICT Greenwood (from Kansas, daughter of a “mostly reformed drug dealer”) astounds in creating a world where assorted murderers, felons, and thieves are sympathetic.\" ―Library Journal",

I find comfort/guidance in novels that deal with religious-esque ideas, without a religious motive — it’s like the author is wrestling with the same existential questions and you’re working together to sus out an answer.   Dostoevsky is great for this - He was Christian but always doubting, so he gives his characters every reason NOT to believe in God, and tries to see if they can experience divine love anyway. The Brothers Karamazov” is his best.   “The Count of Monte Cristo” is great too - a man is wrongly imprisoned, escapes, and dedicates his life to psychologically torturing the people who betrayed him. He calls himself “God’s avenging angel” but acts like a manipulative devil, so it makes you question the line between good & evil, what’s worth living for & what’s more valuable - your enemies’ pain or your own peace. The writing is also horribly exciting, so it’s a very easy read despite being 1000+ pages.   Anything by Mary Oliver. “Upstream” is a memoir/essay collection, “Thirst” is my favorite of her poetry collections. She found the divine in nature & in simple sensory experiences, so there’s a peaceful loving feeling in something as simple as watching a bug crawl across the table.  “It is a serious thing just to be alive on this fresh morning in this broken world.”",

It engages in a multi-disciplinary study of historical events, an examination of scientific studies, and philosophical argumentation to advance Bregman's opinion that, contrary to popular opinion, this outlook is more realistic than its more negative counterpart.*",

How do we fix a broken world while not breaking ourselves? Valarie Kaur—renowned Sikh activist, filmmaker, and civil rights lawyer—describes revolutionary love as the call of our time, a radical, joyful practice that extends in three directions: to others, to our opponents, and to ourselves. It enjoins us to see no stranger but instead look at others and say: You are part of me I do not yet know. Starting from that place of wonder, the world begins to change: It is a practice that can transform a relationship, a community, a culture, even a nation. >  >Kaur takes readers through her own riveting journey—as a brown girl growing up in California farmland finding her place in the world; as a young adult galvanized by the murders of Sikhs after 9/11; as a law student fighting injustices in American prisons and on Guantánamo Bay; as an activist working with communities recovering from xenophobic attacks; and as a woman trying to heal from her own experiences with police violence and sexual assault. Drawing from the wisdom of sages, scientists, and activists, Kaur reclaims love as an active, public, and revolutionary force that creates new possibilities for ourselves, our communities, and our world. See No Stranger helps us imagine new ways of being with each other—and with ourselves—so that together we can begin to build the world we want to see.  ^(This book has been suggested 2 times)  ***  ^(65254 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

On May 27, 1943, his B–24 crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Louis and two other survivors found a raft amid the flaming wreckage and waited for rescue. Instead, they drifted two thousand miles for forty–seven days. Their only food: two shark livers and three raw albatross. Their only water: sporadic rainfall. Their only companions: hope and faith–and the ever–present sharks. On the forty–seventh day, mere skeletons close to death, Zamperini and pilot Russell Phillips spotted land–and were captured by the Japanese. Thus began more than two years of torture and humiliation as a prisoner of war. > >Zamperini was threatened with beheading, subject to medical experiments, routinely beaten, hidden in a secret interrogation facility, starved and forced into slave labour, and was the constant victim of a brutal prison guard nicknamed the Bird–a man so vicious that the other guards feared him and called him a psychopath. Meanwhile, the Army Air Corps declared Zamperini dead and President Roosevelt sends official condolences to his family, who never gave up hope that he was alive. > >Somehow, Zamperini survived and he returned home a hero. The celebration was short–lived. He plunged into drinking and brawling and the depths of rage and despair. Nightly, the Bird's face leered at him in his dreams. It would take years, but with the love of his wife and the power of faith, he was able to stop the nightmares and the drinking. > >A stirring memoir from one of the greatest of the \"Greatest Generation,\" DEVIL AT MY HEELS is a living document about the brutality of war, the tenacity of the human spirit, and the power of forgiveness.  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  ***  ^(45009 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

With Humankind, he brings that mentality to bear against one of our most entrenched ideas: namely, that human beings are by nature selfish and self-interested. > >By providing a new historical perspective of the last 200,000 years of human history, Bregman sets out to prove that we are in fact evolutionarily wired for cooperation rather than competition, and that our instinct to trust each other has a firm evolutionary basis going back to the beginning of Homo sapiens. Bregman systematically debunks our understanding of the Milgram electrical-shock experiment, the Zimbardo prison experiment, and the Kitty Genovese \"bystander effect.\" > >In place of these, he offers little-known true stories: the tale of twin brothers on opposing sides of apartheid in South Africa who came together with Nelson Mandela to create peace; a group of six shipwrecked children who survived for a year and a half on a deserted island by working together; a study done after World War II that found that as few as 15% of American soldiers were actually capable of firing at the enemy. > >The ultimate goal of Humankind is to demonstrate that while neither capitalism nor communism has on its own been proven to be a workable social system, there is a third option: giving \"citizens and professionals the means (left) to make their own choices (right).\" Reorienting our thinking toward positive and high expectations of our fellow man, Bregman argues, will reap lasting success. Bregman presents this idea with his signature wit and frankness, once again making history, social science and economic theory accessible and enjoyable for lay readers.  ^(This book has been suggested 47 times)  ***  ^(145084 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

While the patched-up ship has seen better days, it offers her a bed, a chance to explore the far-off corners of the galaxy, and most importantly, some distance from her past. An introspective young woman who learned early to keep to herself, she’s never met anyone remotely like the ship’s diverse crew, including Sissix, the exotic reptilian pilot, chatty engineers Kizzy and Jenks who keep the ship running, and Ashby, their noble captain. > >Life aboard the Wayfarer is chaotic and crazy—exactly what Rosemary wants. It’s also about to get extremely dangerous when the crew is offered the job of a lifetime. Tunneling wormholes through space to a distant planet is definitely lucrative and will keep them comfortable for years. But risking her life wasn’t part of the plan. In the far reaches of deep space, the tiny Wayfarer crew will confront a host of unexpected mishaps and thrilling adventures that force them to depend on each other. To survive, Rosemary’s got to learn how to rely on this assortment of oddballs—an experience that teaches her about love and trust, and that having a family isn’t necessarily the worst thing in the universe.  ^(This book has been suggested 252 times)  ***  ^(144633 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

As for audio books, if you learned TM through official channels, your name was put into the international database and you have the right to go to any TM center anywhere in the world and get yoru meditation checked or even retake the entire class (except for learning your mantra). That is part of the free-for-life program in the USA.  In the era of COVID, they've got temporarily downloadable app with a timestamp so that you can retake the entire class through videos (except the giving of the mantra) and this is also free. You can also get your meditation checked through a video conference wtih a TM teacher who speaks the language you learned in as you no-longer need to travel to a city with a TM center to get your meditation \"checked.\"  Remember: the followup program is free-for-life at least in the USA. You can contact your nearest TM center via: http://www.tm.org.  I do my best to let people know these things so somehow you missed the existence of r/transcendental (we're only 9+ years old).  .  .  > I don’t know how or when the industry changed but I heard from older practitioners that they learned it at their local ymca for 25 bucks in the 80’s.  Back int eh 1980's, the TM organization was ONLY teaching TM through TM centers, so your friends learned from a poser who was ripping them off by charging money to teach Benson's Relaxation Response.  Now, in 1973, I learned TM as a high schooler (I was actually 18, just out of high school) for $35 dollars, but TM was a fad back then with the Beatles and then with back-to-back-to-back appearances of the founder of TM on various popular TV talk shows.  By the 1980's, the fad had died down and they had doubled or tripled the price to about $125 or so, but that was because they had plans and infrastructure that needed maintaining based on their erroneous projections of future income from looking at their fad days (used to be called \"the Merv [Griffin] Era\" back when everyone knew who he was).  .  In the 1990s, the old monk was considering using Deepak Chopra as his replacement, but they had a falling out, and Chopra took ten years of publicity work by the TM organization to make his name a household word and turned it into a money-making organization specifically for him.  At that point, the old monk realized that he had to rethink things and started boosting the price until finally, a year before he died, the organization was living only on donations because the price was too high to attract anyone but the uber-wealthy, which was his stated goal: \"they set the trends and fashions of Society and the rich don't stop at a poor store.\"  Flashforward 15 years after his death and the price is again on a sliding scale, at least in the USA, with people who make $200,000/year paying $980 and going down from there, with partial scholarships available to lower the price even further.  At the same time, the David Lynch Foundation accepts donations from those who don't blink at paying $980 and hires TM teachers at a fixed rate to go to schools, homeless shelters, Indian Reservations, Veterans Centers, etc, and teach everyone there for free, and then remain embedded as staff for a year, providing the followup TM centers do without the clients/students having to travel miles (or hundreds of miles in hte case of Indian reservations) for said followup.  As well, the DLF provides a concierge service for the uber-wealthy where their CEO or his staff teach them at their homes or offices or wherever. This provides them with a stable of billionaires (15 at last count) and centi-millionaires (over 100 at last count) who are willing to donate vast quantities to expensive causes like translating TM teacher training materials into obscure Native American languages so that the tribes can be taught TM by native speakers.  THAT is what the fees pay for, not to line the pockets of some charlatan at the YMCA pretending to teach TM at a discount.    .",

They told me they learned it at the local Y.  LOL  I don’t remember if it was through David Lynch foundation but I am pretty sure I paid about 1500 back then so hearing that it’s lower than 1000 is great. Maybe prices are going down? I do live in NYC so everything is pricier.   Have you consistently done TM? I feel like 18 year olds might not be open to the idea but 18 year old now and 18 year olds then are different breeds. That’s really interesting! Thank you for all the info and your for sharing your experiences.",

        "text": "Okay so i’ll start by saying a few things. First, good on you for recognizing where you’re at in life, what’s going on in your brain, and seeking to improve things. Second, literature is amazing and can probably help, but it’s not everything and certainly won’t substitute things like therapy or meditation. Third, i haven’t been where you’ve been, so i’m gonna recommend some books but my life experience has been drastically different from yours. Forth, i’m not entirely sure if you’re looking for fiction or self-help-y non-fiction, so i’ll recommend a couple of both.   Man’s Search for Meaning, by Victor Frankl, and Meditations by Marcus Aurelius are both non-fiction books that have helped a lot of people. The Frankl one is about controlling what you can and searching for meaning in your life; he wrote it based largely off his experiences having survived  a Nazi death camp in WW2. Meditations is more a stoic text that focuses on living a virtuous life and developing self discipline to gain control over your own judgements and desires. Both have helped a lot of people.   for fiction i’ll recommend two books: Becky Chambers’s A Psalm for the Wind Built, and Heningway’s The Old Man and the Sea.   Psalm is a very quiet, contemplative journey of a non-binary person finding their way in a strange future world. i found it to be like reading a hug i didn’t know i needed. it’s one of those books where you end up feeling like…everything will be okay. Old Man follows a poor cuban fisherman who is just…the coolest person ever. he struggles through a crazy story and is just…always clear on what needs to be done and accepts his position without judgment, and with a clear understanding of where he’s at and what needs to happen next. it’s…strangely inspiring.   anyways, i hope you find what you need. good luck.",

CPTSD can be hard to work with and a trauma-informed therapist is essential. I had to pinpoint what my triggers were specifically to be able to read and work with workbooks—mine were abandonment trauma and trust issues due to emotional and physical neglect. There are workbooks for these and it has been incredibly helpful for me. I'm 90% less reactive than I use to be and I have learned how to communicate my needs and feelings in a healthy manner.",

They've been put into book form and I've re-read them often. \"Nothing Special\" and \"Everyday Zen\" are my favorites.  This is also one of my favorite stories from the book:  \"The Empty Rowboat\"  \rSuppose we are out on a lake and it’s a bit foggy - not too foggy, but a \r   bit foggy - and we’re rowing along in our little boat having a good time. \r   And then, all of a sudden, coming out of the fog, there’s this other rowboat \r   and it’s heading right at us. And… Crash!  \rWell, for a second we’re really angry - what is that fool doing? I just \r   painted my boat! And here he comes - crash! - right into it. \r   And then suddenly we notice that the rowboat is empty.   \rWhat happens to our anger? Well, the anger collapses… I’ll just have to \r   paint my boat again, that’s all.   \rBut if that rowboat that hit ours had another person in it, how would we \r   react? You know what would happen!   \rNow, our encounters with life, with other people, with events, are like \r   being bumped by an empty rowboat. But we don’t experience it that way. \r   We experience it as though there are people in that other rowboat and we’re \r   really getting clobbered by them…",

It doesn’t take much--just hearing of someone else’s accomplishments, being criticized, getting into an argument, making a mistake at work--to make us feel that we are not okay. Beginning to understand how our lives have become ensnared in this trance of unworthiness is our first step toward reconnecting with who we really are and what it means to live fully.  >--from Radical Acceptance > >Radical Acceptance > >“Believing that something is wrong with us is a deep and tenacious suffering,” says Tara Brach at the start of this illuminating book. This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork--all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach’s twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist students. > >Writing with great warmth and clarity, Tara Brach brings her teachings alive through personal stories and case histories, fresh interpretations of Buddhist tales, and guided meditations. Step by step, she leads us to trust our innate goodness, showing how we can develop the balance of clear-sightedness and compassion that is the essence of Radical Acceptance. Radical Acceptance does not mean self-indulgence or passivity. Instead it empowers genuine change: healing fear and shame and helping to build loving, authentic relationships. When we stop being at war with ourselves, we are free to live fully every precious moment of our lives. > > >From the Hardcover edition.  ^(This book has been suggested 2 times)  [**Trauma-Sensitive Mindfulness: Practices for Safe and Transformative Healing**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191672-trauma-sensitive-mindfulness)  ^(By: David A. Treleaven | 264 pages | Published: ? | Popular Shelves: psychology, trauma, mindfulness, non-fiction, therapy)  >From elementary schools to psychotherapy offices, mindfulness meditation is an increasingly mainstream practice. At the same time, trauma remains a fact of life: the majority of us will experience a traumatic event in our lifetime, and up to 20% of us will develop posttraumatic stress. This means that anywhere mindfulness is being practiced, someone in the room is likely to be struggling with trauma. > > >At first glance, this appears to be a good thing: trauma creates stress, and mindfulness is a proven tool for reducing it. But the reality is not so simple. > > >Drawing on a decade of research and clinical experience, psychotherapist and educator David Treleaven shows that mindfulness meditation—practiced without an awareness of trauma—can exacerbate symptoms of traumatic stress. Instructed to pay close, sustained attention to their inner world, survivors can experience flashbacks, dissociation, and even retraumatization. > > >This raises a crucial question for mindfulness teachers, trauma professionals, and survivors everywhere: How can we minimize the potential dangers of mindfulness for survivors while leveraging its powerful benefits? > > >Trauma-Sensitive Mindfulness offers answers to this question. Part I provides an insightful and concise review of the histories of mindfulness and trauma, including the way modern neuroscience is shaping our understanding of both. Through grounded scholarship and wide-ranging case examples, Treleaven illustrates the ways mindfulness can help—or hinder—trauma recovery. > > >Part II distills these insights into five key principles for trauma-sensitive mindfulness. Covering the role of attention, arousal, relationship, dissociation, and social context within trauma-informed practice, Treleaven offers 36 specific modifications designed to support survivors’ safety and stability. The result is a groundbreaking and practical approach that empowers those looking to practice mindfulness in a safe, transformative way.  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  [**When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/687278.When_Things_Fall_Apart)  ^(By: Pema Chödrön | 160 pages | Published: 1996 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, buddhism, self-help, spirituality, nonfiction)  >The beautiful practicality of her teaching has made Pema Chödrön one of the most beloved of contemporary American spiritual authors among Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike.

The book itself is a memoir of sorts, so by its nature it is self aware. But it is also aware in the sense that it is a story about his life as he tells it, and he tells it in layers of chaotic peelings of his consciousness. Which makes it oddly philosophical, and wonderfully psychological. The character constantly lies to you and admits to doing so while revelling in his own sick way, in the fact he is being an unreliable narrator. It is nihilism at its most desperate hour. My favourite book. I learn something new about myself every time I read it. Which is quite a wonderfully awful thing to do. It is your worst parts of yourself on display smashing you in your face as you read. What it is like to be on the outside of normal society, underground.  Aside from that, I occasionally like flipping through **The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**, but I wouldn't call it a face hugger of a book. Self-helpy in a sort of laissez faire way. **The Stranger** by Camus, was addicting and self helpy for my existential depression, but is not non-fiction. **The Selfish Gene** by Richard Dawkins was incredible, the insights it gives to evolutionary psychology were paradigm shifting for me. Took me too long to get over how pretentious he is and just read his work, which is actually quite good.    Honestly the most addicting books for me have been fiction. There are great books like The Red Queen by Matt Ridley about the evolutionary psychology of sexual selection, or other books about evolution and the \"why\" behind being a social species, which is self help to me, but they just don't suck me in the same way as.... Things Fall Apart, or The Bell Jar... simple easy fiction reads, that deal with not wanting to live and the nature of being human. I do love Russian literature fiction like Dostoevsky, not exactly light reading, and its quite off-putting for most with how pretentious its fans like myself, are, but oh well.   But for Non-fiction I love total suck fests like Night by Elie Wiesel, Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 by Christopher R. Browning, The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang, Unit 731 by Alistair Rogers, and The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. Just absolute PTSD inducing jaw dropping brutality. Why? I have no idea. I may have visited the Anne Frank House too young and its my way to reconcile that shattering trip. Oh I'm rambling quite well now, toodles. Oh and I do not recommend these last books.",

This helped me a lot when I was having confidence issues. Not only do you feel more comfortable verbalizing it, but it helps you really believe it too. I would say things that I knew I would list as strengths in a job interview such as, \"I'm really meticulous in my work and like to make sure that every detail is perfect. I'm great at proof-reading as I have a good eye for mistakes. I'm a good asset to any company because I don't like to be bored, so when I finish my tasks I'm always searching for something else I can do to improve my skills or get an early start on another project.\" I usually did that in the morning, and at night I would focus on other self-things (\"I really liked the way my hair looked today. I'm a good listener.\"). Past this, if you have a friend or family member who would be willing to listen to you brag about yourself, do it! Say the same things you'd say in the mirror to them. Or maybe have them read an interview script and practice with them!",

This year has been really tough for me and on the first day of this year I tried to commit suicide. Clearly it didn’t work there are times where I really wish it did so I understand losing touch with having a purpose. My favorite book ever is [The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11) and always makes me laugh and appreciate things a bit. Some other books that have helped me appreciate the simple life a lot more are [A Walk in the Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791) and [Desert Solitaire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214614). Both of them helped me appreciate the natural world and the world inside of me a lot more. I hope you have a good day and week and month and summer and year and everything. Be well :)",

        "text": "There's a lot of misinformation going around books as well. The best information comes by reading straight from the studies themselves. The studies can be biased, but it's easy to pick out where the biases are coming from, whereas books will tend to repeat studies without going into details about a study's shortcomings.  The best way to read a study is to read the graphs and figures FIRST before reading any of the researchers' interpretations of the graphs. Then check out the scientists' own interpretations to see if they match your own. Then read the summaries on those studies, which will help you condense the data into something accessible to laypeople. Obviously doing all this requires some background in statistics and science. If you dont have that kind of background, and are uninterested or unable to access the prerequisites needed to read scientific papers, then there are books you can read that I'll recommend below. However, it's important that you read books that come from multiple \"sides\" of the issue, so that you can see how one food scientist might respond to another. And try your best to look into an author's sources.   Anyway, here are some good books:  Anti-Diet by Christy Harrison   Whole by T Colin Campbell and Howard Jacobson   Undo it! by Dean Ornish and Anne Ornish  Intuitive Eating by Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch  How Not To Die by Michael Gregor and Gene Stone  Gene Eating by Giles Yeo   My own biases: I am a biologist and have a small (undergraduate level) background in food science research. The type of research i personally did in undergrad (which definitely differs from other researchers) convinced me not to really believe in one-size-fits-all diets. I also don't believe that anyone (including many doctors) should be saying that being \"fat\" is unhealthy. I have a history of very minor disordered eating (like most women), but at this point, the only restriction I put on my diet is that I'm vegetarian. I try not to judge others for eating meat, but i do sometimes do it accidentally. I'm not here to have an argument about what the most ethical foods are. I'm just stating what my biases are before you take my recommendations seriously.",

He promises her the world, but when she discovers she is pregnant — and that her lover is married — she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing through on his way to Japan. But her decision to abandon her home, and to reject her son's powerful father, sets off a dramatic saga that will echo down through the generations. > >Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex and passionate characters — strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis — survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history.  ^(This book has been suggested 7 times)  ***  ^(15009 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

They have opened frontiers, founded cities, settled borders, and fed billions. They promote life, forge peace, grant power, and can capriciously destroy everything in their path. Even today, rivers remain a powerful global force -- one that is more critical than ever to our future. > >In Rivers of Power, geographer Laurence C. Smith explores the timeless yet vastly underappreciated relationship between rivers and civilization as we know it. Rivers are of course important in many practical ways (water supply, transportation, sanitation). But the full breadth of their profound influence on the way we live is less obvious. Rivers define and transcend international borders, forcing cooperation between nations. Huge volumes of river water are used to produce energy, raw commodities, and food. Wars, politics, and demography are transformed by their devastating floods. The territorial claims of nations, their cultural and economic ties to each other, and the migrations and histories of their peoples trace back to rivers, river valleys, and the topographic divides they carve upon the world.  > >Beautifully told and expansive in scope, Rivers of Power reveals how and why rivers have so profoundly influenced our civilization, and examines the importance this vast, arterial power holds for our present, past, and future.  >  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  ***  ^(260 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

Also highly recommend you stick to a female author, as the feelings talked about will be more accurate and reliable. A lot of them give really good examples of communication, as well as bad examples of communication, and walk through what emotional response occured as a result and how the couple overcame it. Two that I read (and reread) last year were one to watch and well met. One to watch had me literally in tears because I identified so strongly with how the language to the main character affected her, and well met gave a strong internal dialogue of the woman's identity - and insecurities - in her relationship. There are lots of romances that focus on personality traits - being plus size, traumatic exes, being differently abled, etc. It might get you a funny look reading them in public, but it might also help teach communication and perspective without getting lost in therapeutic jargon",

Opal's childhood diary, published in 1902, became an immediate bestseller, one of the most talked-about books of its time. Wistful, funny, and wise, it was described by an admirer as \"the revelation of the ...life of a feminine Peter Pan of the Oregon wilderness—so innocent, so intimate, so haunting, that I should not know where in all literature to look for a counterpart.\" But the diary soon fell into disgrace.

Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story—and survive this homecoming. > >Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 0307341550 (ISBN 13: 9780307341556)  ^(This book has been suggested 116 times)  [**Kept in the Dark**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13506596-kept-in-the-dark)  ^(By: Penny Hancock | 352 pages | Published: 2012 | Popular Shelves: thriller, fiction, mystery, crime, suspense | )[^(Search \"Kept in the Dark\")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Kept in the Dark&search_type=books)  >Greenwich, Londra. In un freddo pomeriggio di febbraio, Sonia apre la porta di casa a Jez, 15 anni, un amico del figlio. Il ragazzo vorrebbe vedere un raro disco di vinile, pensa di restare qualche minuto e andare via. Non uscirà più. Con una folle progressione geometrica, un passo dopo l’altro, Sonia fa in modo che Jez non lasci la casa sul fiume, fino a quando non scoprirà di esserne prigioniero, di non poter chiedere aiuto. La sola possibilità che gli restaè trovare un modo per convivere con lei, con quella donna che lo considera una cosa sua, un oggetto da proteggere, da custodire. Non ha altra strada se non venire a patti con la sua carceriera: del resto, chi lo cercherebbe mai in quella splendida, vecchia dimora in riva al Tamigi? Chi sospetterebbe di unamoglie e madre esemplare, che non ha mai mostrato alcun segno di squilibrio? La casa sul fiume è la storia di un’ossessione, di uno smarrimento che affonda le sue radici nei meandri più oscuri della psiche. Ed è la storia di una donna reale e vera come solo il dolore sa esserlo: perché la sua solitudine, i suoi ricordi, i suoi moventi parlano al cuore di ognuno di noi.  ^(This book has been suggested 1 time)  [**Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46815.Wasted)  ^(By: Marya Hornbacher | 298 pages | Published: 1997 | Popular Shelves: non-fiction, memoir, nonfiction, memoirs, psychology | )[^(Search \"Wasted\")](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Wasted&search_type=books)  >Why would a talented young woman enter into a torrid affair with hunger, drugs, sex, and death?

A cultural phenomenon by age twenty-six, she had fame, money, respecteverything she had always wanted except that one, true thing: happiness.  > For all of her professional success, Wurtzel felt like a failure. She had lost friends and lovers, every magazine job she'd held, and way too much weight. She couldn't write, and her second book was past due. But when her doctor prescribed Ritalin to help her focus-and boost the effects of her antidepressants -- Wurtzel was spared. The Ritalin worked. And worked. The pills became her sugar...the sweetness in the days that have none. Soon she began grinding up the Ritalin and snorting it. Then came the cocaine, then more Ritalin, then more cocaine. Then I need more. I always need more. For all of my life I have needed more...  >More, Now, Again is the brutally honest, often painful account of Wurtzel's descent into drug addiction. It is also a love story: How Wurtzel managed to break free of her relationship with Ritalin and learned to love life, and herself, is at the heart of this ultimately uplifting memoir that no reader will soon forget.  ^(This book has been suggested 2 times)  ***  ^(167270 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

I guess you could say it’s a post-modern minimalist book, cause it’s sort of a response and repudiation of Marie Kondo’s popular style of minimalism.  It has a lot to do with minimalism both in your everyday life, but also in art, architecture, music, etc. I recommend.",

This book does a much better job of helping you understand the goals of minimalism and not just the practices of minimalism, if that makes sense?  Edit to add: it helped me understand *why* minimalism can be a useful lens for life, and not just *how* to act like a minimalist.",

It’s not super intense or preachy, just real talk about being okay with who you are and not chasing approval 24/7. Easy to read, kinda comforting, and you’ll probably end up underlining half the book. If you’re into stuff that makes you feel better and think differently, this one’s a solid pick.",

Her father was an anthropologist and her books often consider how culture and ritual shape us in daily life, as well as the value of the seemingly mundane.  In particular, I would say *Tales from Earthsea* and some of the stories in *The Birthday of the World*, especially the story “Solitude” and the very end of the novella “Paradises Lost”.  Some of the Japanese healing novels also touch on these themes. *What You Are Looking For Is In The Library* by Michiko Aoyama is my personal favorite, and features different stories from intertwined characters who find new enjoyment and connection in simple things due to savvy recommendations from an unusual librarian.",

Nobel Laureate Feynman gave these lectures just once, to a group of Caltech undergraduates in 1961 and 1962, and these newly released recordings allow you to experience one of the Twentieth Century's greatest minds—as if you were right there in the classroom.  ^(This book has been suggested 3 times)  ***  ^(5790 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

Recent progress in genetic manipulations and calorie-restricted diets in laboratory animals hold forth the promise that someday science will enable us to exert total control over our own biological aging. > >Nearly all scientists who study the biology of aging agree that we will someday be able to substantially slow down the aging process, extending our productive, youthful lives. Dr. Aubrey de Grey is perhaps the most bullish of all such researchers. As has been reported in media outlets ranging from 60 Minutes to The New York Times, Dr. de Grey believes that the key biomedical technology required to eliminate aging-derived debilitation and death entirely--technology that would not only slow but periodically reverse age-related physiological decay, leaving us biologically young into an indefinite future--is now within reach. > >In Ending Aging, Dr. de Grey and his research assistant Michael Rae describe the details of this biotechnology. They explain that the aging of the human body, just like the aging of man-made machines, results from an accumulation of various types of damage.  As with man-made machines, this damage can periodically be repaired, leading to indefinite extension of the machine's fully functional lifetime, just as is routinely done with classic cars.  We already know what types of damage accumulate in the human body, and we are moving rapidly toward the comprehensive development of technologies to remove that damage.  By demystifying aging and its postponement for the nonspecialist reader, de Grey and Rae systematically dismantle the fatalist presumption that aging will forever defeat the efforts of medical science.  ^(This book has been suggested 10 times)  ***  ^(6606 books suggested | )[^(I don't feel so good.. )](https://debugger.medium.com/goodreads-is-retiring-its-current-api-and-book-loving-developers-arent-happy-11ed764dd95)^(| )[^(Source)](https://github.com/rodohanna/reddit-goodreads-bot)",

What has helped me when I feel alone and kind of like you say you are feeling is I go find somewhere to volunteer. I like sorting food at food banks or walking dogs at the shelter but you might have other interests. It gets me out of the house, out of my comfort zone, and involved with people I might not otherwise meet. Also, with a little luck, volunteering can help you become part of a community of folks who can then also function as a bit of a support system. Knowing I’m helping out gives me a little dopamine shot, too, which is a mood booster.   If you are able, you might consider talking to a counselor or therapist. Even just having someone nonjudgmental to talk to can be a real help.",

        "text": "Unfortunately I can't promise any author is going to prove to always be problematic and you might need to do your own research - I've read and enjoyed authors then read up on their background and found out they're deeply homophobic, or transphobic or donate to actively evil organisations.  The author themself being a member of marginalised community can lessen their problematic nature, but interectionality works both ways unfortunately!  Recommendations will be better if you give some more ideas of what you like, but off the top of my head:  Ursula Le Guin - A great science fiction and fantasy author.  Naomi Novik - Uprooted is a great fantasy stoy drawing on Polish and middle European fairytale. Female fronted and without the usual orcs and elves trappings.  Becky Chambers - Some great LGBT+ science fiction - from cosy spaceships The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet to beautiful hard sci-fi To Be Taught if fortunate.  Alison Rumfitt - The other end of the scale Brainwyrms and Tell Me I'm Worthless are some nasty, shocking and disturbing horror novels from a queer/trans perspective. I'm an old horror ghoul, and these are still horrible.  Susanna Clarke - Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell - the return of magic to Austen Era England written in a great literary/educational style and Piranesi - A man who lives in a maze. Generally has male protagonists, but recognises the female perspective within the history.  Margaret Atwood - Handmaid's Tale etc. Good feminist work and resisted having her work coopted by anti-trans bigots - by telling them to fuck off! She has written some stuff about #metoo having gone too far - she worried it exceeds legal investigation; and I disagree with her 'speculative fiction/science fiction' division - but you might want to read the article (paywalled for me!)  Terry Pratchett is often brought up as a safe fantasy replacement for the likes of Gaiman - I do enjoy his books and while they are informed by him being a straight, white Englishman writing from the 1980s they reflect his progressive beliefs and politics and are very funny and intelligent. He writes capable and rounded female characters and tries to actively resist 'chainmail bikini' fantasy tropes. He has always had a great many female and LGBT+ fans and I have not heard of any problematic behaviour in his personal life. (Aside maybe from accepting a knighthood, but that's certainly low down my list.)  Iain Banks wrote some excellent contemporary novels and as Iain M Banks wrote some gripping science fiction - the Culture series about a post-scarcity civilisation. Player of Games is a good start.  This Is How You Lose the Time War is a fantastic science fiction fantasy LGBT+ epistolary novel by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone.  Tamsyn Muir wrote Gideon the Ninth which is a gripping if hard to explain science fiction novel about queer necromancers in space. Orphans, a crumbling civilisation, minds within minds, dreams within dreams, sarcasm, mirrorshades. People tend to love it or hate it.  Geraldine Brooks - just finished Year of Wonders, an account of life in Eyem - the 1666 plague village. A little bleak, but enjoyable even if I was disappointed by the ending.  Some other thoughts from a different thread for people looking to replace Gaiman in their fantasy canon:  Diana Wynne-Jones - Howl's Moving Castle, Chrestomanci, Archer's Goon  Susan Cooper - The Dark is Rising  John Masefield - The Box of Delights",

Plus authors have their own blindspots - Susanna Clarke recommended Gaiman; but a year ago I probably would have too, not being aware of the allegations.  Are there particular problematic behaviours you want to avoid - some authors are safely dead, and even if Dickens was a shit to his wife at least you're not funding it by giving him money.",

It is a warning how destruction of society begins with accepting that the individual must be destroyed.  It is the idea that any person be it priest, murder, or child can be shown that violence and hatred only inspires thirst for more and eventually the sins and betrayal of peace and life eventually leads to destruction and death.   Also how if a man can shed everything he is or desires or wants to completely devote himself to an idea he can in a way become immortal and be a Bear that dances forever.  Finally it is a metaphor to how God hated Adam for his disobedience to conform to the ideals He set forth, and thus aims to destroy him in body and mind.",

The environments and thus the world that these characters inhabit offer respites to the anarchy that men create. But also, shows that Man are not master's of this world as the violence does not touch the beautiful and peaceful serenity that surrounds them and their chaos.",

They go through ways to combat this and methods to apply in life to achieve your goals of becoming a “better” person. So I would start by just grabbing Stoic books and I don’t think you could go wrong. Most popular is probably Marcus Aurelius who wrote his own book called Meditations.",

It might interest you but it is reviewed as being brutally sad and heartbreaking in places, and I’m just not sure if it might interest you or not but will mention it  “Before I Let You Go” by Kelly Rimmer  Another I might mention is   “Burying the Honeysuckle Girls” by Emily Carpenter. Contemporary American south setting. The female main character is in recovery for substance abuse. Great audiobook narration.",
